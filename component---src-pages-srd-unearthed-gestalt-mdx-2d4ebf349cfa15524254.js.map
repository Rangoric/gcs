The\nprocess is similar to multiclassing, except that characters gain the\nfull benefits of each class at each level. if the two classes you\nchoose have aspects that overlap (such as Hit Dice, attack\nprogression, saves, and class features common to more than one\nclass), you choose the better aspect. The gestalt character retains\nall aspects that don&rsquo;t overlap.\n    <p>The gestalt character variant is particularly effective if you\nhave three or fewer players in your group, or if your players enjoy\nmulticlassing and want characters with truly prodigious powers. This\nvariant works only if every PC in the campaign uses it, and it\nresults in complicated characters who may overwhelm newer players\nwith an abundance of options.</p>\n    <h4><a id=\"building-gestalt-characters\"></a> Building Gestalt\nCharacters</h4>\n    <p>To make a 1st-level gestalt character, choose two <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"classes.html\">standard classes</a>.\n(You can also choose any of the variant classes in this book, though\nyou can't combine two versions of the same class.) Build your\ncharacter according to the following guidelines.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"gestalt-hit-dice\"></a> Hit\nDice</h6>\nChoose the larger Hit Die. A monk/sorcerer would use d8 as her Hit\nDie and have 8 hit points (plus Constitution modifier) at 1st level,\nfor example.\n    <h6><a id=\"gestalt-base-attack-bonus\"></a> Base Attack Bonus</h6>\nChoose the better progression from the two classes.\n    <h6><a id=\"gestalt-base-saving-throw-bonuses\"></a> Base Saving Throw\nBonuses</h6>\nFor each save bonus, choose the better progression from the two\nclasses. For example, a 1st-level gestalt fighter/wizard would have\nbase saving throw bonuses of Fortitude +2, Reflex +0, Will +2\n&mdash; taking the good Fortitude save from the fighter class and\nthe good Will save from the wizard class.\n    <h6><a id=\"gestalt-class-skills-\"></a>\nClass Skills</h6>\nTake the number of skill points gained per level from whichever\nclass grants more skill points, and consider any skill on either\nclass list as a class skill for the gestalt character. For example,\na gestalt barbarian/bard would gain skill points per level equal to\n6 + Int modifier (and have four times this amount at 1st level), and\ncan purchase skills from both the barbarian and bard lists as class\nskills.\n    <h6><a id=\"gestalt-class-features\"></a> Class Features</h6>\nA gestalt character gains the class features of both classes. A\n1st-level gestalt rogue/cleric, for example, gets <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"rogue.html#rogue-sneak-attack\">sneak\nattack</a> +1d6, <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"rogue.html#rogue-trapfinding\">trapfinding</a>, 1st-level <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"cleric.html#cleric-spells\">cleric\nspells</a>, and the ability to <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"cleric.html#cleric-turn-or-rebuke-undead\">turn or rebuke\nundead</a>. Class- and ability-based restrictions (such as arcane\nspell failure chance and a druid's prohibition on wearing metal\narmor) apply normally to a gestalt character, no matter what the\nother class is.\n    <p>A gestalt character follows a similar procedure when he attains\n2nd and subsequent levels. Each time he gains a new level, he\nchooses two classes, takes the best aspects of each, and applies\nthem to his characteristics. A few caveats apply, however.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Class features that two classes share (such as <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"barbarian.html#barbarian-uncanny-dodge\">uncanny dodge</a>)\naccrue at the rate of the faster class.</li>\n      <li>Gestalt characters with more than one spellcasting class keep\ntrack of their spells per day separately.</li>\n      <li>A gestalt character can't combine two prestige classes at any\nlevel, although it's okay to combine a prestige class and a\nregular class. Prestige classes that are essentially class\ncombinations - such as the <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"arcaneTrickster.html\">arcane trickster</a>, <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"mysticTheurge.html\">mystic\ntheurge</a>, and <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"eldritchKnight.html\">eldritch knight</a> - should be\nprohibited if you&rsquo;re using gestalt classes, because they\nunduly complicate the game balance of what&rsquo;s already a\nhigh-powered variant. Because it&rsquo;s possible for gestalt\ncharacters to qualify for prestige classes earlier than normal,\nthe game master is entirely justified in toughening the\nprerequisites of a prestige class so it's available only after 5th\nlevel, even for gestalt characters.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h5><a id=\"gestalt-combinations\"></a>\nGESTALT COMBINATIONS</h5>\nBecause the player of a gestalt character chooses two classes at\nevery level, the possibilities for gestalt characters are almost\nlimitless. The following combinations are particularly potent.\n    <h6><a id=\"barbarian-bard\"></a>\nBarbarian/Bard</h6>\nThe \"barbarian\" has two choices in a battle: use a mix of\nparty-aiding spells and attacks, or rage and use inspirational music\nto urge the rest of the party on as he attacks. Only the bardic\nmusic abilities that actually require a <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#perform\">Perform</a> check (such as countersong\nand fascinate) are off limits during a rage. Neither barbarians nor\nbards wear heavy armor, so gear selection is straightforward.\n    <h6><a id=\"barbarian-wizard\"></a>\nBarbarian/Wizard</h6>\nThe barbarian brings that d12 Hit Die to the table, and that&rsquo;s\nalmost all that matters to the fragile wizard. A good Fortitude save\nis sure to save the gestalt character's hide a few times, and a\nhigh-Intelligence character benefits greatly from the union of two\ndisparate class skill lists. And as a bonus, you're literate at 1st\nlevel. The only downside? You can't cast spells in a rage. This\ncombination deliberately tweaks the stereotypes of both classes, so\nyou'll want to spend some time thinking about your character's\nbackstory.\n    <h6><a id=\"cleric-sorcerer\"></a>\nCleric/Sorcerer</h6>\nThis gestalt combination is effectively the mystic theurge prestige\nclass on steroids. You can load up on combat spells as a sorcerer,\nthen prepare utility and protective spells as a cleric - which you\ncan always spontaneously cast as healing spells if you like. As a\nside benefit, your high Charisma helps both your arcane spellcasting\nand your ability to turn undead.\n    <h6><a id=\"druid-ranger\"></a> Druid/Ranger</h6>\nWith the ranger's base attack bonus, you'll be a more effective\ncombatant when you wild shape into a predator. The extra skills of a\nranger are welcome, and if you choose the archery combat style,\nyou'll be ready for both ranged combat and an up-close fight in wild\nshape form.\n    <h6><a id=\"fighter-ranger\"></a>\nFighter/Ranger</h6>\nIf you like feats, this is the class for you. Most fighters must\nchoose whether to split their feats between melee and ranged combat\nor emphasize one kind of attack at the expense of the other. The\nfighter/ranger can have it both ways, relying on the fighter bonus\nfeats to improve melee attacks and the ranger's combat style,\nimproved combat style, and combat style mastery to pick up three\ngood archery feats.\n    <h6><a id=\"fighter-rogue\"></a>\nFighter/Rogue</h6>\nEvery rogue likes to get behind the enemy and dish out sneak attack\ndamage. With this gestalt combination, that trick gets even better\nbecause you have the hit points and Armor Class to survive\ntoe-to-toe with the enemy, you'll hit more often, and you get more\nattacks, which just means more chances to pick up a fistful of d6s.\nYou can wear heavy armor, but you'll degrade some of your better\nskills and you'll lose access to evasion.\n    <h6><a id=\"monk-cleric\"></a> Monk/Cleric</h6>\nYou'll probably give up your armor, but you can run around the\nbattlefield in a blur, healing your comrades and putting the hurt on\nthe bad guys with such combinations as stunning fist with an <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#inflict-serious-wounds\">inflict serious\nwounds</a> spell attached. Once you draw up your new character, note\nhow many great cleric spells have a range of touch. The same Wisdom\nscore that drives your spellcasting also improves your Armor Class.\n    <h6><a id=\"monk-sorcerer\"></a> Monk/Sorcerer\nand Monk/Wizard</h6>\nWith three good saves, more hit points, and the best unarmored Armor\nClass, the monk covers up many of the weak points of the sorcerer or\nwizard. The only downside is that the important ability scores for\nsorcerers and wizards &mdash; Charisma and Intelligence &mdash; are\nthe two ability scores that the monk cares least about. This can be\na tough combination to pull off, especially if you&rsquo;re using\npoint-based ability score generation.\n    <h6><a id=\"paladin-sorcerer\"></a>\nPaladin/Sorcerer</h6>\nCharisma does the heavy lifting for this gestalt combination. Why?\nTwo words: divine grace. Like all sorcerers, you'll send your\nCharisma score into the stratosphere with the every-four-levels\nimprovement and the best cloak of Charisma you can afford. Every\ntime you get more spells, your saving throws improve as well. The\ndownside? You can't wear armor like most paladins.\n    <h6><a id=\"sorcerer-wizard\"></a>\nSorcerer/Wizard</h6>\nUnlike most gestalt characters, your hit points, Armor Class, base\nattack bonus, and saving throws aren't any better than a standard\nsorcerer or wizard. But oh, the spells you can cast! Unlike a\nstandard arcane spellcaster, you can afford to use your\nhighest-level spells in most of your serious fights. It's a good\nidea to use your sorcerer slots on combat spells (such as the\nubiquitous <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsFtoG.html#fireball\">fireball</a>) and the occasional\ndefense or utility spell (perhaps <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsMtoO.html#mage-armor\">mage armor</a> or <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#haste\">haste</a>). Then\nyou can use your wizard slots for spells that are great against\nspecific foes (such as <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsDtoE.html#dimissal\">dismissal</a>) or life-savers in\nspecific situations (<a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsFtoG.html#gaseous-form\">gaseous form</a>). You can\ngamble a little more with your wizard spell selection because you\nknow you have all those useful sorcerer spells backing you up.\n    <h4><a id=\"balancing-gestalt-characters\"></a> Balancing Gestalt\nCharacters</h4>\nObviously, this variant results in characters who are significantly\nmore powerful than is standard. But how much more powerful? The\nsimple answer - that gestalt characters are twice as powerful as\nstandard characters &mdash; isn't accurate. Gestalt characters don't\nhave an advantage in the most important game currency: available\nactions. Even a character who can fight like a barbarian and cast\nspells like a sorcerer can't do both in the same round. A gestalt\ncharacter can't be in two places at once as two separate characters\ncan be. Gestalt characters who try to fulfill two party roles (melee\nfighter and spellcaster, for example) find they must split their\nfeat choices, ability score improvements, and gear selection between\ntheir two functions.\n    <p>While a gestalt character isn't as powerful as two characters of\nequal level, a gestalt character is more powerful than a standard\ncharacter. Hit points will always be at least equal to those of a\nstandard character, saving throws will almost certainly be better,\nand gestalt characters have versatility that standard characters\ncan't achieve without multiclassing. Furthermore, a party of gestalt\ncharacters has greater durability and many more spells per day, so\nthey can often take on six or more consecutive encounters without\nstopping to rest and prepare more spells.</p>\n    <p>Your players may be excited by the chance to play fighters with\npowerful sneak attacks or spellcasters who can cast any spell. But\nas the game master, you know that the only measure of PC power that\nmatters is the comparison with NPC power. By throwing monsters of\nhigher Challenge Ratings at them, you'll still be giving them\nsignificant challenges. Gestalt characters look superior compared to\nstandard characters, but that's a false comparison. With this\nvariant, such \"standard\" characters don't exist.</p>\n    <p>Here's how to build a campaign that can handle gestalt\ncharacters.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"challenge-ratings\"></a>\nChallenge Ratings</h6>\nGestalt characters can obviously handle more opposition than\nstandard characters. The simplest way to compensate for this is to\nuse adventures with tougher monsters. In general, a party of four\ngestalt characters can handle multiple encounters with a single\nmonster of a Challenge Rating equal to their average level + 1. If\nthe monster poses a challenge because it forces the characters to\nsucceed on life-threatening saving throws (such as with a <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"monstersMtoN.html#medusa\">medusa</a> or\na <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"monstersTtoZ.html#wyvern\">wyvern</a>), it's even weaker\nagainst gestalt characters, who have few or no weak saves.\nCharacters can handle multiple encounters with such monsters at a\nChallenge Rating equal to their average level + 2. A <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"monstersS.html#shambling-mound\">shambling mound</a> (CR 6) or\na medusa (CR 7) would be appropriate average encounters for four\n5th-level gestalt characters. If you take this approach, realize\nthat characters gain levels faster than in a typical campaign,\nbecause they're gaining experience points as if those encounters\nwere harder than they actually are. You're obviously comfortable\nwith a high-powered game, so faster advancement may be an additional\nbenefit, not a problem. if you rely on published adventures, this is\nthe easiest option.\n    <p>If you want to keep level advancement at the standard average of\nthirteen encounters per level, reduce the Challenge Ratings of all\nthe monsters and NPCs in your campaign by 1 (or by 2 if they rely on\nfailed PC saving throws to pose a challenge). The <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersS.html#shambling-mound\">shambling mound</a> and the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersMtoN.html#medusa\">medusa</a>\nwould both become CR 5 monsters, and the gestalt characters gain\nlevels at the usual rate. Monsters with a Challenge Rating of 1\nbecome CR 1/2, and other monsters with fractional Challenge Ratings\nhave their CRs cut in half (kobolds become CR 1/6, in other words).\nMany staple low-CR monsters don't work well against a party of\ngestalt characters, even 1st-level gestalts.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"adventure-design\"></a> Adventure\nDesign</h6>\nOnce you adjust the Challenge Ratings, you have one more subtle\nfactor to consider when you design adventures for gestalt\ncharacters. You must take into account the greater \"adventure\nstamina\" of gestalt characters both when you're preparing an\nadventure and when you're at the gaming table running the adventure.\nBecause gestalt characters have more hit points, better saving\nthrows, and deeper spellcasting lists than standard characters, they\ncan safely tackle more encounters in a row before they run low on\nhit points and spells.\n    <p>Gestalt characters can, for example, delve deeply into a dungeon\non their first foray, when the dungeon denizens may not be expecting\nthem. The defenders of any site in a site-based adventure can't rely\non wearing out a party of gestalt characters. They have to pose\nenough of a threat that the gestalt characters retreat because\nthey're worried about their hides, not just because the wizard is\nalmost out of spells.</p>\n    <p>In event-based adventures, gestalt characters can wreak havoc\nwith timetables because they have more resources at their disposal.\nFor example, a 10th-level gestalt wizard/sorcerer can easily\nteleport the entire party four times a day - without resorting to\nscrolls. That means two round trips to visit the wizened sage who's\nan expert in rune translation, each in the blink of an eye.</p>\n    <p>At the gaming table, you may want to plan longer gaming sessions\nbecause rest periods for the characters are natural stopping points\nfor the players, and gestalt characters have fewer rest periods. if\nyou do stop in the middle of the action, encourage your players to\ntake careful notes of which class abilities they expend, which\nspells they have active, and other relevant information. Gestalt\ncharacters are complex enough that relying solely on memory is a\nrecipe for trouble.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"npcs\"></a> NPCs</h6>\nAn important aspect of most campaigns is verisimilitude &mdash;\nwhich is centered on the notion that everything in the campaign\nworld is obeying the same set of rules. Accordingly, any important\nNPCs in your game should also be gestalt characters. It's probably\nnot necessary to have low-level noncombatant NPCs pick two classes,\nbut any NPCs above 1st level should be constructed as gestalt\ncharacters. (NPCs with levels only in NPC classes - <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"npcClasses.html#adept\">adept</a>, <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"npcClasses.html#aristocrat\">aristocrat</a>, <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"npcClasses.html#commoner\">commoner</a>,\n    <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"npcClasses.html#expert\">expert</a>,\nand <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"npcClasses.html#warrior\">warrior</a> - can remain standard\ncharacters.)\n    <h6><a id=\"prestige-classes\"></a> Prestige\nClasses</h6>\nThe high-powered nature of the gestalt character variant gives you\nmore room to create unique prestige classes. First, you can create\nnarrowly specialized prestige classes, and they'll still be\ncompelling choices for PCs because the characters can simultaneously\nadvance in a regular class while taking levels in the prestige\nclass. Players won't feel shoehorned into a very specific prestige\nclass if they have another class they're also advancing in. Second,\nyou can create truly outrageous prestige classes - but add the\nadditional cost that such classes take up both class choices for\ngestalt characters. For example, a prestige class that offered a d12\nHit Die, +1/level base attack bonus, two good saves, full\nspellcasting, and a host of class features would be completely\nunbalanced in a standard game. But if it takes up both \"class slots\"\nfor a gestalt characters, it's no more powerful than taking a level\nin the barbarian/wizard gestalt.\n    <h6><a id=\"campaign-pacing\"></a> Campaign\nPacing</h6>\nOnce it is adjusted as outlined above, a campaign that employs\ngestalt characters isn't that different from a standard campaign.\nGestalt characters don't gain access to key campaign-changing\nabilities faster than their standard counterparts. No gestalt\ncharacter can use <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsTtoZ.html#teleport\">teleport</a> or <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsPtoR.html#raise-dead\">raise the\ndead</a> under her own power before 9th level, and no non-monk\ngestalt character gets a second melee attack in a round before 6th\nlevel. Gestalt characters get to tackle monsters a level or two\nahead of time, but they're still fighting gnolls at low levels,\npurple worms at middle levels, and balors at high levels. Perhaps\nthe only noticeable difference in terms of campaign pacing is that\ngestalt PCs are \"something special\" from the beginning. They are far\nmore powerful than typical 1st-level commoners even at the beginning\nof the campaign. Again, this difference only matters for a level or\ntwo, because standard 3rd level characters are also far more\npowerful than 1st-level commoners.\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
