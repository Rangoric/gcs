</table>\n    <h5><a id=\"preparing-spells\"></a>PREPARING SPELLS</h5>\nWith this variant, spellcasters still prepare spells as normal (assuming they normally\nprepare spells). In effect, casters who prepare spells are setting their list of\n\"spells known\" for the day. They need not prepare multiple copies of the same spell,\nsince they can cast any combination of their prepared spells each day (up to the\nlimit of their spell points).\n    <p>For example, a 4th-level wizard with an Intelligence score of 16, when using\nthe spell point system, would prepare four 0-level spells, four 1st-level spells\n(three plus her bonus spell for high Int) and three 2nd-level spells (two plus her\nbonus spell for high Int). These spells make up her entire list of spells that she\ncan cast during the day, though she can cast any combination of them, as long as\nshe has sufficient spell points.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"bonus-spell-points-and-bonus-spells\"></a>Bonus Spell Points and Bonus Spells</h6>\nAny spellcaster who would normally receive bonus spells for a high ability-score\nreceives bonus spell points instead. In effect, the character can simply cast more\nof her spells each day.\n    <p>To determine the number of bonus spell points gained from a high ability score,\nfirst find the row for the character's ability score on Table: Bonus Spell Points.\nUse whichever ability score would normally award bonus spells for the character's\nclass (Wisdom for clerics and druids, Intelligence for wizards, and so forth).</p>\n    <p>Next, find the coulumn for the highest level of spell the characrer is capable\nof casting based on her class level (even if she doesn't have a high enough ability\nscore to cast spells of that level). At the point where the row and coulumn intersect,\nyou find the bonus spell points a character gains. This value can change each time\nher ability score undergoes a permanent change (such as from an ability score increase\ndue to character level or one from a <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsTtoZ.html#wish\">wish</a> spell)\nand each time her level changes.</p>\n    <p> For example, the 4th-level wizard with an Intelligence score of 16 is capable\nof casting 2nd-level spells. The number on Table: Bonus Spell Points at the intersection\nof the 16-17 row and the 2nd column is 4, so she has 4 extra spell points each day (in\naddition to the 11 points she gets from being a 4th-level wizard). If her Intelligence\nwere increased to 20 because of <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsFtoG.html#foxs-cunning\">fox's cunning</a>\nspell or a Headband of Intellect +4, she wouldn't gain any additional bonus spell\npoints, since those effects produce temporary changes, not permanent changes. However,\nwhen she reaches 5th level, her bonus spell points would increase from 4 to 9 (since\nshe is now capable of casting 3rd-level spells and thus uses that column), and her\noverall total would increase from 15 to 25.</p>\n    <p>A character who would normally receive bonus spells from a class feature (such as\nfrom wizard specialization or access to a domain) can instead prepare extra spells\nof the appropriate levels, domains, and/or shcools. The character doesn't get any\nextra spell points (and thus can't cast any more spell than normal), but the added\nflexibility of being able to use the bonus spell more than once per day makes up\nfor that.</p>\n    <p>For instance, a specialist wizard can prepare one extra spell from the chosen\nschool of each spell level that she can cast. A cleric can prepare one domain spell\n(chosen from amond his domain spells available) of each spell level that he can\ncast.</p>\n    <p>For example, if the previous 4th-level wizard were an evoker, she could prepare\none additional spell per level, but that spell would have to be from the evocation\nschool. Once it is prepared, she can use that spell just like any of her other spells,\ncasting it as often as she has spell points.</p>\n    <p>Another example: At 1st level, a cleric gains a bonus 1st-level spell, which\nmust be selected from one of his two domains. Once it is prepared, he can use that\ndomain spell just like any of his other spells, casting it as often as he has spell\npoints.</p>\n    <p>For class features that grant bonus spells of a nonfixed spell lecel (such as\nthe <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"dragonDisciple.html\">dragon disciple's</a> bonus spells), the character\ninstead gains a number of bonus spell points equal to twice the highest spell level\nhe can cast, minus 1 (minimun 1 point) each time he gains a bonus spell. This is a\nfixed value - it doesn't increase later as the character gains levels - though later\nrewards may be larger as appropriate to the character's spellcasting ability.</p>\n    <p>For example, a 4th-level fighter/4th-level sorcerer who gains a level of <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"dragonDisciple.html\">dragon disciple</a>\ngets a bonus spell. Since the character is capable of casting 2nd-level spells,\nshe receives 3 bonus spells points (2*2=4, 4-1=3).</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"spontaneous-spellcasting\"></a>Spontaneous Spellcasting</h6>\nCharacters who cast all their spells spontaneously - such as bards and sorcerers\n-  don't have to prepare spells. They can cast any spell they know by spending the\nrequisite number of spell points.\n    <p>Characters with the ability to cast a limited nimber of spells spontaneously\n(such as druids, who can spontaneously cast a <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsS.html#summon-natures-ally-i\">summon nature's ally</a>\nspell in place of another spell of the same level) are always treated as having\nthose spells prepared, without spending any spell slots to do so. Thus they can\ncast such spells any time they have sufficien spell points.</p>\n    <p>Under this sytem, the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"clericDomains.html#healing\">Healing</a> domain\nbecomes a relatively poor choice for good-aligned clerics, since they gain less\nof a benefit for that domain. See <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"unearthedClasses.html#spontaneous-divine-casters\">Spontaneous Divine Casters</a> for ways to solve that dilemma.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"regaining-spell-points\"></a>Regaining Spell Points</h6>\nSpellcasters regain lost spell ponts whenever they could normally regain spells.\nDoing this requires the same amount of rest and preparation or concentration time\nas normal for the class. Without this period of rest and mental preparation, the\ncaster's mind isn't ready to regain its power. Spell points are not divorced from\nthe body; they are part of it. Using spell points is mentally tiring, and without\nthe requisite preriod of rest, they do not regenerate. Any spell points spelnt within\nthe last 8 hours count against a character's daily limit and aren't regained.\n    <h5><a id=\"casting-spells\"></a>CASTING SPELLS</h5>\nEach spell costs a cetain number of spell points to cast. The higher the level of\nthe spell, the more points it costs.

Spells that deal a\nnumber of dice of damage based on caster level (such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile\">magic missile</a>,\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsS.html#searing-light\">searing light</a>, or <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#lightning-bolt\">lightning bolt</a>)\ndeal damage as if cast by a character of the minimum level of the class capable\nof casting the spell. Spells whose damage is partially based on caster level, but\nthat don't deal a number of dice of damage based on caster level (such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsPtoR.html#produce-flame\">produce flame</a>\nor an <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#inflict-light-wounds\">inflict</a> spell) use the\nspellcaster's normal caster level to determine damage. Use the character's normal\ncaster level for all other effects, including range and duration.</p>\n    <p>For example, a <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsFtoG.html#fireball\">fireball</a> deals a number\nof dice of damage based on the caster's level, so when cast by a wizard using this\nsystem, it deals 5d6 points of damage (as if cast by a 5th-level wizard, which is\nthe minimum level of wizard capable of casting fireball). A sorcerer who casts the\nsame spell deals 6d6 points of damage, since the minimum level of sorcerer capable\nof casting fireball is 6th.</p>\n    <p>A character can pay additional spell points to increase the dice of damage dealt\nby a spell. Every 1 extra spell point spent at the time increases the spells effective\ncaster level by 1 for purposes of dealing damage. A character can't increase a damage-dealing\nspell's caster level above her own caster level, or above the normal maximum allowed\nby the spell.</p>\n    <p>For example, even at 7th level, a wizard's <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#lightning-bolt\">lightning bolt</a>\ndeals only 5d6 points of damage (just like a 5th-level wizard) unless she spends\nextra spell points. If she spends 1 extra spell point (making the lighting bolt\ncost 6 points rather than 5), the spell deals 6d6 points of damage. A second extra\nspell point would increase the damage to 7d6 points, but she can't spend more points\nthan this, since her caster level is only 7th. Were she 10th level or higher, she\ncould spend a maximum of 5 extra spell points on this spell, raising the damage\nup to 10d6, the maximum allowed for a lighting bolt spell.</p>\n    <p>Similarly, her <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile\">magic missile</a> spell\nonly shoots one missile unless she spends extra spell points. An extra 2 spell points\nincreases the caster level from 1st to 3rd, granting her one additional missile.\nShe can spend a maximum of 6 additional spell points in this manner, increasing\nher effective caster level to 7th for damage purposes and granting her a total of\nfour missiles. If she were 9th level or higher, she could spend a maximum of 8 extra\nspell points, granting her five missiles (just like a 9th-level caster).</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"metamagic-and-spell-points\"></a>METAMAGIC AND SPELL POINTS</h5>\nIn the spell point system, a DM has two options for how to adjudicate metamagic\neffects. In either case, casters need not specially prepare metamagic versions of\ntheir spells - they can simply choose to apply the metamagic effect at the time\nof casting. Doing this does not increase the spells casting time.\n    <p>The first option is to apply an additional spell point cost to any spell cast\nwith a metamagic feat. This option allows a character maximum flexibility in her\nchoice of spellcasting. Effectively, the character must pay for the spell as if\nit were a higher-level spell, based on the adjustment from the metamagic feat. If\nthe metamagic effect(s) would increase the spell's effective level above what she\nis capable of casting, she can't cast the spell in that way.</p>\n    <p>For example, a 7th level wizard is capable og casting 4th-level spells. She\ncould empower a 2nd-level spell, or still a 3rd-level spell, or empower and still\na 1st-level spell. She couldn't empower a 3rd-level spell or still a 4th-level spell\n(since doing either of those things would raise either spell's effective spell level\nto 5th).</p>\n    <p>The spell's caster level for purposes of damage-dealing effects (see above) doesn't\nchange, even if the metamagic effect increases the minimum caster level of that\nspell. For instance, a quickened <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsFtoG.html#fireball\">fireball</a>\nstill deals damage as if cast by a 5th-level caster unless the caster chooses to\npay additional spell points to increase the caster level.</p>\n    <p>For example, if a wizard empowered her <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile\">magic missile</a>\nit would cost her 5 spell points (as if it were a 3rd-level spell) but would shoot\nonly one missile and deal (1d4+1)*1.5 points of damage. If she spend an additional\n6 spell points (for a total of 11), the caster level of the magic missile would\nincrease to 7th, and the spell would shoot four missiles dealing a total of (4d4+4)*1.5\npoints of damage.</p>\n    <p>The second option is simpler but less flexible. In this option, each selection\nof a metamagic feat allows a character to apply the feat's effect three times per\nday at no additional spell point cost. The normal limit for maximum spell level\napplies (a 7th-level wizard can't empower a spell higher than 2nd level, for instance).</p>\n    <p>You could even combine these options, allowing a spellcaster with a metamagic\nfeat to use the feat three times per day for free, but any additional uses in the\nsame day would cost extra spell points. Only choose this combination approach if\nyou're comfortable with characters throwing around a lot of metamagic spells.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"multiclass-spellcasters\"></a>MULTICLASS SPELLCASTERS</h5>\nA character with nonstacking spellcasting ability from multiple classes (such as\na cleric/wizard) has a separate pool of spell points for each spellcasting class.\nSuch characters may only spend spell points on spells granted by that class. Bonus\nspell points from a high ability score apply to each pool separately, even if the\nsame ability score is tied to more than one spellcasting class. In the rare situations\nwhen a character has prepared or knows the same spell in two different slots (such\nas a druid/ranger preparing <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsDtoE.html#delay-poison\">delay poison</a>\nas both a 2nd-level druid spell and a 1st-level ranger spell), the character can\ncast the spell using either pool of spell points, but the spell is treated as being\ncast by a caster of the level of the class from which the spell points are drawn.\n    <p>For example, a 5th-level cleric/2nd-level bard has 15 spell points (plus bonus\nspell points for high Wisdom) for his cleric spells and 0 spell points (plus bonus\nspell points for high Charisma) for his bard spells. When he casts <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsC.html#cure-moderate-wounds\">cure moderate wounds</a>,\nthe points for that spell must be drawn from his pool of cleric spell points. If\nhe knows <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsC.html#cure-light-wounds\">cure light wounds</a> as a bard\nspell and has also prepared it as a cleric spell, he may cast it either as a cleric\nor as a bard. As a cleric spell, the spell is cast at 5th level and heals 1d8+5\npoints of damage; as a bard spell, it is cast at 2nd level and heals 1d8+2 points\nof damage.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"miscellaneous-issues\"></a>MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES</h5>\nWhen a character would lose a spell slot (such as from gaining a negative level),\nhe instead loses the number of spell points required to cast his highest level spell.\n    <p>Spells that allow a character to recall or recast a spell don't function in this\nsystem. (It doesn't make any sense to have a spell that gives you more spell points,\nsince you're either paying more than you get, getting nothing, or getting more than\nyou paid.) Items that function similarly can work, but differently - they restore\na number of spell points required to cast a spell of that level. A Pearl of Power\nfor 3rd-level spells, for instance, would restore 5 spell points to a character's\npool of available points when activated.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"spell-point-variant-vitalizing\"></a>SPELL POINT VARIANT: VITALIZING</h5>\n    <a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/UnA_Gallery/79175.jpg\"><img className=\"art-wide\" src=\"pict.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"pict\" style={{\n        \"border\": \"0px solid\",\n        \"width\": \"73px\",\n        \"height\": \"75px\"\n      }} /></a>\nIn the vitalizing system, spellcasters can potentially cast a great number of spells\nin a day, but every spell cast is a potential burden on the caster's health and\nvitality. Reaching for and directing magical energy is a dangerous and taxing exercise,\nat least as difficult as heavy labor or prolonged exertion.\n    <p>This variant of the spell point system does not change the way a character prepares\nspells, casts spells, regains spell points, or any of the other rules from that\nsystem. However, the spellcaster's pool of spell points represents a physical, not\njust mental, limit on his spellcasting power.</p>\n    <p>When a spellcaster's spell points pool falls to half of his maximum or less,\nhe becomes <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued\">fatigued</a>.</p>\n    <p>When his spell points drop to one-quarter of his maximum or less, he becomes\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#exhausted\">exhausted</a>.</p>\n    <p>For example, a 1st-level cleric with 3 spell points (2 for his level, +1 bonus\nspell point for high Wisdom) enters a fight by casting <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsAtoB.html#bless\">bless</a>\non his allies, spending 1 of his 3 spell points. Doing this has no ill effect on\nhim, since he still has more than half his spell points remaining. If, during the\nfight, he then casts <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsDtoE.html#divine-favor\">divine favor</a>, spending\nanother spell point, he now becomes <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued\">fatigued</a>, since he has only one-third of his\nspell points remaining.

A character's spell point total is tied directly\nto his level of fatigue. If an <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#exhausted\">exhausted</a>\ncharacter rests for 1 hour, he becomes <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued\">fatigued</a>\n- and his spell point total rises to one-third of his maximum (round fractions down).\nA second hour of rest increases the spellcaster's spell point total to two-thirds\nof his maximum. It takes another 6 hours of rest to replenish the last one-third\nof his spell points and shake the physical effects of the spellcasting. Spells that\nremove fatigue and exhaustion (such as <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#heal\">heal</a> and\n    <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsPtoR.html#restoration\">restoration</a>) leave the recipient with\na spell point total equal to two-thirds of his normal maximum.\n    <p>As in the standard rules, a spellcaster mist rest for a full 8 hours before preparing\na fresh allotment of spells for the day. Even if an <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#exhausted\">exhausted</a>\nspellcaster regains his lost energy and spell points, he can't change the spells\nhe has prepared without 8 hours of rest.</p>\n    <p><b>Mundane Fatigue:</b> If a spellcaster is subject to some other effect that\nwould make him <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued\">fatigued</a> or <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#exhausted\">exhausted</a>,\nhe loses spell points accordingly. If he becomes fatigued, his spell point total\ndrops to one-half of his normal maximum (round down), and if her becomes exhausted,\nhis spell point total drops to one-quarter his normal maximum.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"optional-vitalizing-variants\"></a>Optional Vitalizing Variants</h6>\nAs a further variant of this system, all spellcasters gain bonus spell points based\non their Constitution scores rather than the ability score that normally grants\nbonus spells. This variant reflects the idea that spellcasting power is tied to\nthe caster's physical health. It also essentially requires spellcasters to have\ntwo high ability scores, though most spellcasters are happy to have a high Constitution\nscore anyway.\n    <p>A second optional variant would allow a spellcaster to exceed his normal pool\nof spell points, but at great personal risk. Doing so successfully requires a <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#concentration\">Concentration</a>\ncheck (DC 20 + spell level). Each time a character casts a spell for which he does\nnot have sufficient spell points and subsequently fails the Concentration check,\nhe takes both lethal and nonlethal damage equal to the level of the spell cast.\nA desperate (or unwary) spellcaster can literally cast himself into unconsciousness\nin this manner.</p>\n    <h5><a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"behind-the-curtain-spell-points\"></a>BEHIND THE CURTAIN: SPELL POINTS</h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>The spell point system dramatically expands the versality of a spellcaster.\nSince she's no longer tied to using a specific number of spell slots, she can much\nmore easily adapt to situations. In effect, spell points make all classes work more\nlike the sorcerer, and make the sorcerer (or bard) work even more like the sorcerer.\nIn general, spellcasters become more powerful - though they aren't capable of casting\nany spell they couldn't cast before, they are now capable of casting more high-level\nspells per day and more of whichever spells they need. If a 15th-level cleric needs\nto cast <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#heal\">heal</a> a dozen times during an adventure,\nhe can do that (though not much else).\n      <p>One balancing factor is the cost for casters to increase the damage dealt by\ntheir spells. This cost helps to maintain balance between spells of different level.\nIf you didn't have to pay more for a 5d6 <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#lightning-bolt\">lightning bolt</a>\n(a 3rd-level spell costing 5 spell points), then the 9d6 lightning bolt would cost\nbarely more than half as much as a 9d6 <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"spellsC.html#cone-of-cold\">cone of cold</a>\n(a 5th-level spell costing 9 spell points), even though both spells deal equal damage.</p>\n      <p>If you use this variant, consider adding other game elements that influence (or\nare influenced by) spell points. These might include magic items that grant (or\ncost) spell points, feats that grant bonus spell points (or make certains spells\ncost fewer spell points to cast), special abilites that drain spell points from\ncasters, and so forth.</p></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"house-rule-daily-spell-list\"></a>HOUSE RULE: DAILY SPELL LIST</h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>This variant spontaneous casting system is designed for spellcasters who normally\nprepare their spells in advance (including clerics, druids, paladins, rangers, and\nwizards). A spellcaster using this variant prepares the same number of spells per\nspell level as normal. However, instead of preparing the exact combination of spells\nthat she can cast that day (such as two <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile\">magic missile</a>\nspells and one <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsMtoO.html#mage-armor\">mage armor</a> spell for a 2nd-level\nwizard with Int 14), the spellcaster prepares a list of spells for each spell level\nfrom which she can spontaneously cast as she chooses.\n      <p>For example, that 2nd-level wizard with Int 14 would prepare four different 0-level\nspells and three different 1st-level spells. During the day, she can cast any combination\nof those four 0-level spells a total of four times, and any combination of those\nthree 1st-level spells a total of three times. In effect, the caster's list of prepared\nspells is treated like a sorcerer's list of spells known.</p>\n      <p>Unlike what a sorcerer can do, a spellcaster using this system can't cast a lower-level\nspell in place of a higher-level spell. If you use this variant, decide whether\nclerics and druids retain their normal spontaneous casting options (<a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"spellsC.html#cure-light-wounds\">cure</a>\nor <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#inflict-light-wounds\">inflict</a> spells for clerics,\n        <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"spellsS.html#summon-natures-ally-i\">summon nature's ally</a> spells for\ndruids). You can either rule that the character must prepare the spell in question\nto have it available for spontaneous casting, or that such spells are always available\nfor spontaneous casting (as if the character prepared it \"for free\").</p>\n      <p>Bards and sorcerers obviously can't use this system, since they already have\ntheir own spontaneous casting method. For bards, that's not a big deal - their spellcasting\npowers are only a portion of their class features, so no real change is merited.\nSorcerers still have an advantage over wizards in that they can cast more spells\nper day, but the versality gained by the wizard definitely infringes on the sorcerer's\npower level. To compensate, consider granting the sorcerer one additional spell\nper day for every spell level except his highest. A 1st-level sorcerer would thus\nbe able to cast one extra 0-level spell each day, while a 6th-elvel sorcerer would\nbe able to cast one additional 0-, 1st-, and 2nd-level spell.</p>\n      <p>In the last 2nd Edition AD&#38;D campaign I ran, I incorporated this spontaneous\ncasting variant rule for all spellcasters in the campaign. In some ways, the system\nlooks similar to the method a sorcerer uses to cast his daily allotment of spells,\nbut it allows greater flexibility than that typically enjoyed by a sorcerer.</p></div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"80px\"\n    }}><i>-Andy Collins</i></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"house-rule-simplified-npc-spellscasters\"></a>HOUSE RULE: SIMPLIFIED NPC SPELLCASTERS</h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>I enjoy running high-level NPC spellcasters because they have the potential to challenge\nand surprise my players. Sometimes, however, I feel as if I'm not playing the evil\nwizard or vile cleric up to his potential. These characters are supposed to be incredibly\nintelligent or at least frighteningly intuitive, yet when I choose their spells\nbefore the adventure begins, I can't always anticipate choices my players will make.\nSo I cheat... just a bit.\n      <p>When I create a villainous NPC spellcaster who prepares spells, I write down the\nspells the character has prepared, but only the top two or three levels' worth.\nThen I pick one or two spells of every level lower than that to simulate spells\nmy evil wizard, cleric, or druid would like to focus on. Finally, I record the number\nof spell slots, by level, the character has left open. I allow my NPC to use these\nslots to cast spells \"on the fly,\" assuming that my incredibly intelligent or wise\nmastermind prepared \"just the right spell\" for whatever situation migh come up.\nHere's how a sample NPC 9th-level wizard's spell selection might look, assuming\nan Intelligence score of 22:</p>\n      <p><i>Wizard Spells Prepared</i> (4/6/6/4/3/2; save DC 16 + spells level): 0 - <i>daze</i>,\n3 open slots; 1 - <i>hold portal, magic missile, protection from good,</i> 3 open\nslots; 2 - <i>alter self, detect thoughts, false life,</i> 3 open slots; 3  - <i>fireball,\nhold person,</i> 2 open slots; 4 - <i>globe of invulnerability, lesser, ice storm,\npolymorph</i>; 5 - <i>cloudkill, baleful polymorph</i>.</p>\n      <p>No spells are duplicated. Some spells (particularly lower-level ones) might not\nbe big combat spells, but probably fit into the theme of the character or the situation.\nI want my NPC to be flexible, but not overpowering. He can still cast <i> magic missile</i>\nfour times if he wants, but not six.</p>\n      <p>If I give metamagic feats to an NPC, I don't let him cast metamagic spells \"on\nthe fly.\" Those spells require special preparedness, so if I want my NPC wizard\nto have a stilled <i>teleport</i> or a quickened <i>magic missile</i>, I put it\nin an appropriate spell slot.</p></div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"80px\"\n    }}><i>-Ed Stark</i></div>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
