Outside factors can affect a\ncharacter&#8217;s Leadership score, as detailed above.</p>\n    <p><i>Cohort Level</i>: The character can attract a cohort of up\nto this level. Regardless of a character&#8217;s Leadership score, he can\nonly recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The\ncohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A\ncharacter can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and\nalignment. The cohort&#8217;s alignment may not be opposed to the leader&#8217;s\nalignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the\nleader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an\nalignment different from his own.</p>\n    <p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p>\n    <dl>\n      <dd>The cohort does not count as a party member when\ndetermining the party&#8217;s XP.</dd>\n      <dd>Divide the cohort&#8217;s level by the level of the PC with whom\nhe or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who\nattracted the cohort).</dd>\n      <dd>Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and\nadd that number of experience points to the cohort&#8217;s total.</dd>\n      <dd>If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one\nlower than the associated PC&#8217;s character level, the cohort does not\ngain the new level&#8212;its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed\nattain the next level.</dd>\n    </dl>\n    <p><i>Number of Followers by Level</i>: The character can lead up\nto the indicated number of characters of each level.
