A school of magic is a group of related spells that\nwork in similar ways. A small number of spells (<a href=\"spellsAtoB.html#arcane-mark\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>arcane\nmark</a>, <a href=\"spellsHtoL.html#limited-wish\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>limited wish</a>, <a href=\"spellsPtoR.html#permanency\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>permanency</a>,\n      <a href=\"spellsPtoR.html#prestidigitation\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>prestidigitation</a>, and <a href=\"spellsTtoZ.html#wish\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>wish</a>)\nare universal, belonging to no school.</p>\n    <a id=\"abjuration\"></a><h6>Abjuration</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Abjurations are protective spells. They create\nphysical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical abilities,\nharm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another\nplane of existence. </p>\n    <p>If one abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of another\nfor 24 hours or more, the magical fields interfere with each other and\ncreate barely visible energy fluctuations. The DC to find such spells\nwith the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#search\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Search</a> skill drops by 4.</p>\n    <p>If an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of\ncreatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used to push away those\ncreatures. If you force the barrier against such a creature, you feel a\ndiscernible pressure against the barrier. If you continue to apply\npressure, you end the spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"conjuration\"></a><h6>Conjuration</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five\nsubschools. Conjurations bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or\nsome form of energy to you (the summoning subschool), actually\ntransport creatures from another plane of existence to your plane\n(calling), heal (healing), transport creatures or objects over great\ndistances (teleportation), or create objects or effects on the spot\n(creation). Creatures you conjure usually, but not always, obey your\ncommands.</p>\n    <p>A creature or object brought into being or transported to your\nlocation by a conjuration spell cannot appear inside another creature\nor object, nor can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive\nin an open location on a surface capable of supporting it. The creature\nor object must appear within the spell&#8217;s range, but it does not have to\nremain within the range.</p>\n    <a id=\"calling\"></a><p><b>Calling</b>: A calling spell transports a creature from\nanother plane to the plane you are on. The spell grants the creature\nthe one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the\nspell may limit the circumstances under which this is possible.\nCreatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do not\ndisappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see\nbelow). The duration of a calling spell is instantaneous, which means\nthat the called creature can&#8217;t be dispelled.</p>\n    <a id=\"creation\"></a><p><b>Creation</b>: A creation spell manipulates matter to create\nan object or creature in the place the spellcaster designates (subject\nto the limits noted above). If the spell has a duration other than\ninstantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and when the spell\nends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the\nspell has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is\nmerely assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not\ndepend on magic for its existence.</p>\n    <a id=\"healing\"></a><p><b>Healing</b>: Certain divine conjurations heal creatures or\neven bring them back to life.</p>\n    <a id=\"summoning\"></a><p><b>Summoning</b>: A summoning spell instantly brings a\ncreature or object to a place you designate. When the spell ends or is\ndispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came\nfrom, but a summoned object is not sent back unless the spell\ndescription specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes\naway if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0 or lower. It is not\nreally <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>dead</a>. It takes 24 hours for the\ncreature to reform, during which\ntime it can&#8217;t be summoned again.</p>\n    <p>When the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature\ndisappears, all the spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature\ncannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have, and it refuses\nto cast any spells that would cost it XP, or to use any spell-like\nabilities that would cost XP if they were spells.</p>\n    <a id=\"teleportation\"></a><p><b>Teleportation</b>: A teleportation spell transports one or\nmore creatures or objects a great distance. The most powerful of these\nspells can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning spells, the\ntransportation is (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.\nTeleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane.\nAnything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.</p>\n    <a id=\"divination\"></a><h6>Divination</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Divination spells enable you to learn secrets\nlong forgotten, to predict the future, to find hidden things, and to\nfoil deceptive spells.</p>\n    <p>Many divination spells have cone-shaped areas. These move with\nyou and extend in the direction you look. The cone defines the area\nthat you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple\nrounds, you can often gain additional information, as noted in the\ndescriptive text for the spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"scrying\"></a><p><b>Scrying</b>: A scrying spell creates an <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>invisible</a> magical\nsensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor\nhas the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This level of\nacuity includes any spells or effects that target you, but not spells\nor effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is treated as a\nseparate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions\nnormally even if you have been <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>blinded</a>, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#deafened\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>deafened</a>, or otherwise suffered\nsensory impairment. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or\nhigher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence check. The\nsensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell.</p>\n    <p>Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks a scrying spell,\nand you sense that the spell is so blocked.</p>\n    <a id=\"enchantment\"></a><h6>Enchantment</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Enchantment spells affect the minds of others,\ninfluencing or controlling their behavior.</p>\n    <p>All enchantments are mind-affecting spells. Two types of\nenchantment spells grant you influence over a subject creature.</p>\n    <a id=\"charm\"></a><p><b>Charm</b>: A charm spell changes how the subject views you,\ntypically making it see you as a good friend.</p>\n    <a id=\"compulsion\"></a><p><b>Compulsion</b>: A compulsion spell forces the subject to\nact in some manner or changes the way her mind works. Some compulsion\nspells determine the subject&#8217;s actions or the effects on the subject,\nsome compulsion spells allow you to determine the subject&#8217;s actions\nwhen you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control over the\nsubject.</p>\n    <a id=\"evocation\"></a><h6>Evocation</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Evocation spells manipulate energy or tap an\nunseen source of power to produce a desired end. In effect, they create\nsomething out of nothing. Many of these spells produce spectacular\neffects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of damage.</p>\n    <a id=\"illusion\"></a><h6>Illusion</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of\nothers. They cause people to see things that are not there, not see\nthings that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that\nnever happened.</p>\n    <a id=\"figment\"></a><p><b>Figment</b>: A figment spell creates a false sensation.\nThose who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not their own\nslightly different versions of the figment. (It is not a personalized\nmental impression.) Figments cannot make something seem to be something\nelse. A figment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate\nintelligible speech unless the spell description specifically says it\ncan. If intelligible speech is possible, it must be in a language you\ncan speak. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot speak, the\nimage produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of\nsomething unless you know what it looks like.</p>\n    <p>Because figments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they\ncannot produce real effects the way that other types of illusions can.\nThey cannot cause damage to objects or creatures, support weight,\nprovide nutrition, or provide protection from the elements.\nConsequently, these spells are useful for confounding or delaying foes,\nbut useless for attacking them directly. </p>\n    <p>A figment&#8217;s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.</p>\n    <a id=\"glamer\"></a><p><b>Glamer</b>: A glamer spell changes a subject&#8217;s sensory\nqualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something\nelse, or even seem to disappear.</p>\n    <a id=\"pattern\"></a><p><b>Pattern</b>: Like a figment, a pattern spell creates an\nimage that others can see, but a pattern also affects the minds of\nthose who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting\nspells.</p>\n    <a id=\"phantasm\"></a><p><b>Phantasm</b>: A phantasm spell creates a mental image that\nusually only the caster and the subject (or subjects) of the spell can\nperceive. This impression is totally in the minds of the subjects. It\nis a personalized mental impression. (It&#8217;s all in their heads and not a\nfake picture or something that they actually see.) Third parties\nviewing or studying the scene don&#8217;t notice the phantasm. All phantasms\nare mind-affecting spells.</p>\n    <a id=\"shadow\"></a><p><b>Shadow</b>: A shadow spell creates something that is\npartially real from extradimensional energy. Such illusions can have\nreal effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion is real.</p>\n    <a id=\"saving-throws-and-illusions-disbelief\"></a><p><b>Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief)</b>: Creatures\nencountering an illusion usually do not receive saving throws to\nrecognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with\nit in some fashion.</p>\n    <p>A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be\nfalse, but a figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.</p>\n    <p>A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to\nnotice something is amiss. A character faced with proof that an\nillusion isn&#8217;t real needs no saving throw. If any viewer successfully\ndisbelieves an illusion and communicates this fact to others, each such\nviewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.</p>\n    <a id=\"necromancy\"></a><h6>Necromancy</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Necromancy spells manipulate the power of\ndeath, unlife, and the life force. Spells involving undead creatures\nmake up a large part of this school. </p>\n    <a id=\"transmutation\"></a><h6>Transmutation</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Transmutation spells change the properties of\nsome creature, thing, or condition. </p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
