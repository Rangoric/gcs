activated, although sometimes\nactivation is accomplished simply by picking up an item or putting it\non. Some items, once they are carried or worn, function constantly. In\nmost cases, using an item requires a standard action that does not\nprovoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, power completion items\n(see below) are treated just like powers in combat and do provoke\nattacks of opportunity.\n    <p>Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item\ndescription indicates otherwise. The manifesting time of a power is the\ntime required to activate the same power in an item, whether it&#8217;s a\npower stone, a dorje, or a psionic tattoo, unless the item description\nspecifically states otherwise.</p>\n    <p>The four ways to activate psionic items are described below.</p>\n    <a id=\"power-completion\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Power Completion:</span> This\nis the activation method for power stones. A power stone holds a power\nthat is mostly finished. All that&#8217;s left to do is perform the short,\nsimple, finishing parts of the manifestation (the final mental coda, as\nit were). To use a power completion item safely, a character must be of\nhigh enough level in the appropriate class to manifest the power\nalready. If he can&#8217;t already manifest the power, there&#8217;s a chance he&#8217;ll\nmake a mistake (see Brainburn in the power stone description).\nActivating a power completion item is a standard action and provokes\nattacks of opportunity exactly as manifesting a power does.</p>\n    <p>Powers stored in power completion items are usually not\naugmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to\nbe the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an\nitem&#8217;s description may specify otherwise (some power stones have\nmanifester levels higher than the minimum required to manifest the\nstored power, and are then assumed to be augmented as well).</p>\n    <a id=\"power-trigger\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Power Trigger:</span> This is\nthe activation method for dorjes and psicrowns. It requires the special\nknowledge of power manifestation that a character of the appropriate\nclass would know, and the formation of the appropriate command thought.\nIf a power is on a character&#8217;s power list, the character knows how to\nuse a power trigger item that stores that power. The user must still\ndetermine what power is stored in the item before she can activate it.\nActivating a power trigger item is a standard action that does not\nprovoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <p>Powers stored in power trigger items are not augmented. Such\npowers are assumed to be stored in the item at the minimum manifester\nlevel necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may\nspecify a higher manifester level than necessary. If such an item holds\na power that deals hit point damage, the power is assumed to be\naugmented to the maximum allowed by the power and the manifester level.</p>\n    <a id=\"command-thought\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Command Thought:</span> If no\nactivation method is suggested either in the psionic item description\nor by the nature of the item, assume that a command thought is needed\nto activate it. Command thought activation means that a character\nmentally projects a thought, and the item activates. No other special\nknowledge is needed. Activating a command thought psionic item is a\nstandard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. </p>\n    <p>Sometimes the command thought to activate an item is mentally\nimprinted within it and is whispered into the mind of a creature who\npicks it up. Other items are silent, but a <a href=\"psionicSkills.html#knowledge-psionics\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Knowledge (psionics)</a> or <a href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Knowledge</a>\n(history) check might\nbe useful in helping to identify\ncommand thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with\nthe command thought in this case. The power psionic identify reveals\ncommand thoughts.</p>\n    <p>Powers stored in command thought items are usually not\naugmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to\nbe the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.</p>\n    <a id=\"use-activated\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Use-Activated:</span> This\ntype of psionic item simply has to be used to activate. Use activation\nis generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>\n    <p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears.\nSome items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this\nactivation sometimes requires a command thought (see above), usually it\nmeans mentally willing the activation to happen&nbsp; (a free action).\nThe description of an item states whether a command thought is needed\nin such a case.</p>\n    <p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic\nitem is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not\nprovoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an\naction that provokes attacks of opportunity in itself. If the use of\nthe item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use activation\nis a standard action. If the item&#8217;s activation is subsumed in its use\nand takes no extra time, use activation is not an action at all.</p>\n    <p>Use activation doesn&#8217;t mean that if you use an item, you\nautomatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess)\nwhat the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the\nbenefit of the item comes automatically.</p>\n    <p>Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not\naugmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to\nbe the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.</p>\n    <a id=\"saving-throws-against-psionic-item-powers\"></a><h5>SAVING THROWS AGAINST PSIONIC ITEM POWERS</h5>\nPsionic items produce psionic powers. The DC of a saving throw against\na power from a psionic item is always 10 + the level of the power or\neffect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to\nmanifest that level of power.\n    <p>Another way to figure the same number is to multiply the\npower&#8217;s level by 1-1/2 and add 10 to the result.</p>\n    <p>Psicrowns are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw\nas if the wielder manifested the power, including manifester level and\nall\nmodifiers to save DC.</p>\n    <p>Some psionic items take advantage of the fact that powers can\nbe augmented to increase their saving throw DCs. These items are\nspecial and have their cost to create and market price calculated using\nthe manifester&#8217;s level instead of the power&#8217;s level.</p>\n    <p>Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various\neffects, particularly when the effect has no exact power equivalent\n(making its level otherwise difficult to quickly determine).</p>\n    <a id=\"damaging-psionics-items\"></a><h5>DAMAGING PSIONIC ITEMS</h5>\nA psionic item doesn&#8217;t need to make a saving throw unless it is\nunattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder\nrolls a natural 1 on his saving throw. Psionic items should always get\na save against powers or spells that might deal damage to them - even\nagainst attacks from which a mundane item would normally get no chance\nto save. All types of psionic item saves - Fortitude, Reflex, and\nWill - are calculated the same way: The item&#8217;s saving throw bonus\nequals\n2 + 1/2 its manifester level (round down). The only exceptions to this\nrule are intelligent psionic items, which make Will saves based on\ntheir own Wisdom scores.\n    <p>A psionic item, unless otherwise noted, takes damage as a\nnormal item of the same type. A damaged psionic item continues to\nfunction, but if it is destroyed, all its psionic power is lost.</p>\n    <a id=\"reparing-items\"></a><h5>REPAIRING ITEMS</h5>\nSome psionic items (especially psionic weapons and shields) may take\ndamage over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a\npsionic item with the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#craft\" style={{\n      \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n    }}>Craft</a> skill than it does to\nrepair its nonpsionic\ncounterpart. The <a href=\"spellsMtoO.html#make-whole\" style={{\n      \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n    }}>make whole</a> spell can repair a\ndamaged - but not\ncompletely broken - psionic item.\n    <a id=\"intelligent-items\"></a><h5>INTELLIGENT ITEMS</h5>\nSome psionic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all\ntheir own. Only permanent psionic items (as opposed to those that are\nsingle-use items, those that have charges, or those that store power\npoints) can be intelligent. (This means that psionic tattoos, power\nstones, and dorjes, among other items, are never intelligent.) In\ngeneral, less than 1% of psionic items have intelligence.\n    <a id=\"cursed-items\"></a><h5>CURSED ITEMS</h5>\nSome psionic items are cursed - incorrectly made, or corrupted by\noutside\nforces. Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or\nthey might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient\nrequirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are\ncursed 5% of the time.\n    <a id=\"charges-and-multiple-uses\"></a><h5>CHARGES AND MULTIPLE USES</h5>\nSome items are limited in power by the number of charges they hold or\nthe number of power points they contain. Normally, charged items (such\nas dorjes) have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a\nrandom part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the\nnumber of charges left (round down, minimum 1).\n    <p>Similarly, items that contain power points (such as psicrowns)\nhave a number of points equal to 50 x the manifester level of the\ncreator. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll\nd% and divide by 2 to determine the number by which the manifester\nlevel is multiplied (round down, minimum 1).</p>\n    <p>Market prices given on the tables are always for fully charged\nor fully powered items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged\nor fully powered.) For an item that&#8217;s worthless when its charges or\npower points run out (which is the case for almost all charged or\npowered items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to\nthe number of charges left.
