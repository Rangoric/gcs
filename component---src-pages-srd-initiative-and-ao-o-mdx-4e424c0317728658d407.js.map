An initiative check\nis a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her Dexterity\nmodifier to the roll. Characters act in order, counting down from\nhighest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters\nact in the same order (unless a character takes an action that results\nin his or her initiative changing; see Special Initiative Actions). If\ntwo or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the\ncombatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier\n(highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should\nroll again to determine which one of them goes before the other.</p>\n    <a id=\"flat-footed\"></a><p><b>Flat-Footed</b>: At the start of a battle, before you have\nhad a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn in\nthe initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can&#8217;t use your\nDexterity bonus to AC (if any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues\nhave the uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which allows them to\navoid losing their Dexterity bonus to AC due to being flat-footed. A\nflat-footed character can&#8217;t make attacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <a id=\"inaction\"></a><p><b>Inaction</b>: Even if you can&#8217;t take actions, you retain\nyour initiative score for the duration of the encounter.</p>\n    <a id=\"surprise\"></a><h5>SURPRISE</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When a combat starts, if you are not aware of\nyour opponents and they are aware of you, you&#8217;re surprised.</p>\n    <a id=\"determining-awareness\"></a><h6>Determining Awareness</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Sometimes all the combatants on a side are\naware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some\nof them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the\nother combatants on each side are unaware.</p>\n    <p>Determining awareness may call for Listen checks, Spot checks,\nor other checks.</p>\n    <a id=\"the-surprise-round\"></a><p><b>The Surprise Round</b>: If some but not all of the\ncombatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens\nbefore regular rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the opponents can\nact in the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In initiative\norder (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of\ntheir opponents each take a standard action during the surprise round.\nYou can also take free actions during the surprise round. If no one or\neveryone is surprised, no surprise round occurs.</p>\n    <a id=\"unaware-combatants\"></a><p><b>Unaware Combatants</b>: Combatants who are unaware at the\nstart of battle don&#8217;t get to act in the surprise round. Unaware\ncombatants are flat-footed because they have not acted yet, so they\nlose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n    <a id=\"attacks-of-opportunity\"></a><h3>ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"line\"> </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her\nguard down. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her\nlapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called\nattacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <a id=\"threatened-squares\"></a><p><b>Threatened Squares</b>: You threaten all squares into which\nyou can make a melee attack, even when it is not your action.\nGenerally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space\n(including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a\nthreatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you&#8217;re\nunarmed, you don&#8217;t normally threaten any squares and thus can&#8217;t make\nattacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <a id=\"reach-weapons\"></a><p><i>Reach Weapons</i>: Most creatures of Medium or smaller size\nhave a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee\nattacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However,\nSmall and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more squares\nthan a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium\nhave a natural reach of 10 feet or more.</p>\n    <a id=\"provoking-and-attack-of-opportunity\"></a><p><b>Provoking an Attack of Opportunity</b>: Two kinds of\nactions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened\nsquare and performing an action within a threatened square.</p>\n    <a id=\"moving\"></a><p><i>Moving</i>: Moving out of a threatened square usually\nprovokes an attack of opportunity from the threatening opponent. There\nare two common methods of avoiding such an attack&#8212;the <a href=\"actionsInCombat.html#step-5-ft\">5-foot-step</a> and\nthe <a href=\"actionsInCombat.html#withdraw\">withdraw</a> action.</p>\n    <a id=\"performing-a-distracting-act\"></a><p><i>Performing a Distracting Act</i>: Some actions, when\nperformed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity as you\ndivert your attention from the battle. Table: Actions in Combat notes\nmany of the actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <p>Remember that even actions that normally provoke attacks of\nopportunity may have exceptions to this rule.</p>\n    <a id=\"making-an-attack-of-opportunity\"></a><p><b>Making an Attack of Opportunity</b>: An attack of\nopportunity is a single melee attack, and you can only make one per\nround. You don&#8217;t have to make an attack of opportunity if you don&#8217;t\nwant to.</p>\n    <p>An experienced character gets additional regular melee attacks\n(by using the full attack action), but at a lower attack bonus. You\nmake your attack of opportunity, however, at your normal attack\nbonus&#8212;even if you&#8217;ve already attacked in the round.</p>\n    <p>An attack of opportunity &#8220;interrupts&#8221; the normal flow of\nactions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked,\nimmediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the\nnext character&#8217;s turn (or complete the current turn, if the attack of\nopportunity was provoked in the midst of a character&#8217;s turn).</p>\n    <a id=\"combat-reflexes-and-additional-attacks-of-opportunity\"></a><p><i>Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity</i>:\nIf you have the Combat Reflexes feat you can add your Dexterity\nmodifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a\nround. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given\nopportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of\nopportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of\nopportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving\nout of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same\nround doesn&#8217;t count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All\nthese attacks are at your full normal attack bonus.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","id","border","cellPadding","cellSpacing","style","className","href","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
