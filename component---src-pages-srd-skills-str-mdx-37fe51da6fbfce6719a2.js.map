While climbing, you can&#8217;t move to avoid a blow,\nso you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can&#8217;t use a\nshield while climbing.</p>\n    <p>Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check\nagainst the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your\ncurrent height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.</p>\n    <p><i>Accelerated Climbing</i>: You try to climb more quickly\nthan normal. By accepting a &#8211;5 penalty, you can move half your speed\n(instead of one-quarter your speed).</p>\n    <p><i>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds</i>: You can make\nyour own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing\nso takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of\ndistance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a\nwall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with\na handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.</p>\n    <p><i>Catching Yourself When Falling</i>: It&#8217;s practically\nimpossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb\ncheck (DC = wall&#8217;s DC + 20) to do so. It&#8217;s much easier to catch\nyourself on a slope (DC = slope&#8217;s DC + 10).</p>\n    <p><i>Catching a Falling Character While Climbing</i>: If someone\nclimbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch\nthe falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so\nrequires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character\n(though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if\ndesired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC =\nwall&#8217;s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling\ncharacter, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot\nexceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail\nyour Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character&#8217;s fall\nbut don&#8217;t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you\nfail to stop the character&#8217;s fall and begin falling as well.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Climbing is part of movement, so it&#8217;s generally\npart of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement\nin a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires\na separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character\ndoesn&#8217;t take an action.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: You can use a rope to haul a character upward\n(or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your\nmaximum load in this manner.</p>\n    <p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because\nhalflings are agile and surefooted.</p>\n    <p>The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb\nchecks.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#athletic\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Athletic</a> feat, you get a +2\nbonus on Climb checks.</p>\n    <p>A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all\nClimb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or\nslope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10,\neven if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb\nspeed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its\nclimb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a\nsingle Climb check at a &#8211;5 penalty. Such a creature retains its\nDexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents\nget no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however,\nuse the run action while climbing.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href=\"skillsAll.html#use-rope\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Use\nRope</a>, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a\nknotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p>\n    <h5>JUMP (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: The DC and the distance you can\ncover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).</p>\n    <p>Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30\nfeet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your\nspeed is less than 30 feet, you take a &#8211;6 penalty for every 10 feet of\nspeed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you\ngain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.</p>\n    <p>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start,\nwhich requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before\nattempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the\njump is doubled.</p>\n    <p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal\nmaximum movement in a round.</p>\n    <p>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you\nland on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check\nuntrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.</p>\n    <p><i>Long Jump</i>: A long jump is a horizontal jump, made\nacross a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you\nattain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal\ndistance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).</p>\n    <p>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end.\nIf you fail the check by less than 5, you don&#8217;t clear the distance, but\nyou can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You\nend your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling\nover a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15\nClimb check.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Long Jump Distance</th>\n          <th>Jump DC<sup>1</sup></th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>5 feet</td>\n          <td>5</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>10 feet</td>\n          <td>10</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>15 feet</td>\n          <td>15</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>20 feet</td>\n          <td>20</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>25 feet</td>\n          <td>25</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">30 feet</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">30</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"2\">1 <i>Requires a 20-foot running start.\nWithout a running start, double the DC.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p><i>High Jump</i>: A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach\na ledge high above or to grasp something overhead.

You do not have to get a running start to\njump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p>\n    <p>If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you\nhad dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: None. A Jump check is included in your\nmovement, so it is part of a move action. If you run out of movement\nmid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on\nyour next turn) must be a move action to complete the jump.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: Effects that increase your movement also\nincrease your jumping distance, since your check is modified by your\nspeed.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#run\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Run</a> feat, you get a +4 bonus on\nJump checks for any jumps made after a running start.</p>\n    <p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because\nhalflings are agile and athletic.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#acrobatic\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Acrobatic</a> feat, you get a +2\nbonus on Jump checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href=\"skillsAll.html#tumble\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Tumble</a>,\nyou get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on\nTumble checks.</p>\n    <h5>SWIM (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: Make a Swim check once per round\nwhile you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to\none-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your\nspeed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no\nprogress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.</p>\n    <p>If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check\nor because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold\nyour breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to\nyour Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take\nmove actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a\nfull-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the\nduration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round.\n(Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only\nhalf as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC\n10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each\nround, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the\nConstitution check, you begin to drown.</p>\n    <p>The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on\nthe table below.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Water</th>\n          <th>Swim DC</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Calm water</td>\n          <td>10</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Rough water</td>\n          <td>15</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Stormy water</td>\n          <td>20<sup>1</sup></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"2\">1 <i>You can&#8217;t take 10 on a Swim check in\nstormy water,\neven if you aren&#8217;t otherwise being threatened or distracted.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or\ntake 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: A successful Swim check allows you to swim\none-quarter of your speed as a move action or one-half your speed as a\nfull-round action.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: Swim checks are subject to double the normal\narmor check penalty and encumbrance penalty.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#athletic\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Athletic</a> feat, you get a +2\nbonus on Swim checks.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#endurance\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Endurance</a> feat, you get a +4\nbonus on Swim checks made to avoid taking nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>\n    <p>A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its\nindicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus\non any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The\ncreature always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if\ndistracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run\naction while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
