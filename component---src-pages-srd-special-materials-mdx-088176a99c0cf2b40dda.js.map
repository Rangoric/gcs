Some creatures have damage reduction based on their\ncreature type or core concept. Some are resistant to all but a special\ntype of damage, such as that dealt by evil-aligned weapons or\nbludgeoning weapons. Others are vulnerable to weapons of a particular\nmaterial. Characters may choose to carry several different types of\nweapons, depending upon the campaign and types of creatures they most\ncommonly encounter. </p>\n    <a id=\"adamantine\"></a><p><b>Adamantine</b>: This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of\na weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a\nnatural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking\nobjects, ignoring hardness less than 20. Armor made from adamantine\ngrants its wearer damage reduction of 1/&#8211; if it&#8217;s light armor, 2/&#8211; if\nit&#8217;s medium armor, and 3/&#8211; if it&#8217;s heavy armor. Adamantine is so costly\nthat weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality;\nthe masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus,\nadamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack\nrolls, and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1\ncompared to ordinary armor of its type. Items without metal parts\ncannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine,\nbut a quarterstaff could not.</p>\n    <p>Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be\nfashioned from adamantine. Weapons, armor and shields normally made of\nsteel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than\nnormal.

Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow,\nan arrow, or a spear) made from darkwood is considered a masterwork\nitem and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type.\nItems not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a\nbattleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain\nany special benefit from being made of darkwood. The armor check\npenalty of a darkwood shield is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary\nshield of its type.

In each case, enough hide is available to produce a small or\nlarge masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the\ndragon is Large or larger.</p>\n    <p>Because dragonhide armor isn&#8217;t made of metal, druids can wear\nit without penalty.</p>\n    <p>Dragonhide armor costs double what masterwork armor of that\ntype ordinarily costs, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary\narmor of that type.</p>\n    <p>Dragonhide has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and\nhardness 10.</p>\n    <a id=\"cold-iron\"></a><p><b>Iron, Cold</b>: This iron, mined deep underground, known\nfor its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower\ntemperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold\niron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, any\nmagical enhancements cost an additional 2,000 gp. </p>\n    <p>Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An\narrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not.</p>\n    <p>A double weapon that has only half of it made of cold iron\nincreases its cost by 50%.</p>\n    <p>Cold iron has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness\n10.</p>\n    <a id=\"mithral\"></a><p><b>Mithral</b>: Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening\nmetal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. When worked like\nsteel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor and\nis occasionally used for other items as well. Most mithral armors are\none category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other\nlimitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are\ntreated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. Spell\nfailure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased\nby 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check\npenalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).</p>\n    <p>An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item\nmade from other metals.
