It unifies the rules for crafting items and\ncreating magic items, while also replicating a character's ability to come\nup with just the thing he needs for a specific task in the nick of time.\nIt glosses over the realities of such work-tool kits, alchemical reagents,\nlaboratories, long hours of toil, and the like � to keep the game moving\nalong at an exciting pace. After all, fighting giants, demons, and dragons\nis generally a lot more fun than waiting for Klamzo to finish crafting a\nnew <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"magicItemsPRR.html#ring-of-protection\">ring of protection</a>.\n    <p>\nTo craft an item without spending the normal labor time, a character with\nthe appropriate item creation feat (such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#craft-masterwork-armor\">Craft Masterwork Armor</a>,\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#brew-potion\">Brew Potion</a>, or <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#craft-staff\">Craft Staff</a>; see below) can pay one-tenth the item's market\nprice in craft points (minimum 1 point). He must also pay material costs\nequal to one-half the item's market price (this replaces the normal\nmaterial cost for crafting an item). For a magic item, the character must\nalso pay the normal experience point cost for crafting the item. Once the\ncharacter declares that he is spending these craft points and gold pieces\n(and experience points, for a magic item), the item is automatically\ncompleted one day later (typically the next morning).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThough this makes it appear as if the item was created \"instantly,\" the\nassumption is that the character has actually been working on it for a\nwhile, but only now got around to finishing it. For instance, Klamzo might\nhave been tinkering with Kroh's sword for some time, but only now has\nfinished improving its enhancement bonus. The system\nsimply assumes that characters are always working on various projects in\ntheir spare time, whether between forays into the dungeon, while on the\nroad, or even while gathered around the campfire after battling goblins in\nthe Sunless Citadel. Thus, when the time comes, they simply spend the\nrequisite gold and craft points, and the item is \"finished\" one day later.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTo spend craft points toward the creation of an alchemical, masterwork, or\nmagic item, you must have the requisite Craft feat (such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#craft-masterwork-armor\">Craft\nMasterwork Armor</a> for creating a masterwork chain shirt) or assist someone\nwho does (see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#assisting\">Assisting</a>, below). Crafting nonmasterwork armor and weapons\nor simple items � tools, chests, saddles, and the like � doesn't require a\nCraft feat. Anyone who helps with the creation of such an item can\ncontribute craft points at the normal rate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor nonmagical items, you must make a successful <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#craft\">Craft</a> check to complete\nthe item. For a masterwork item, use the DC of the item or of the\nmasterwork component, whichever is higher. A failed check means you waste\none-half of the gold pieces and craft points required for the item, but\nyou may try again as soon as the next day if you still have enough gold\npieces and craft points to complete the item. Magic items require no\nskill check to\ncomplete.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nYou can reduce the amount of craft points required by increasing the\namount of time you spend working on the item. For nonmagical items, reduce\nthe craft point cost by 1 point for every 100 sp of work you contribute to\nthe item's creation (see the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#craft\">Craft</a> skill). For magic items, each 8-hour\nday spent working on the item reduces the craft point cost by 100.\n    </p>\n    <a id=\"table-sample-crafted-items\"></a><b>Table: Sample Crafted Items</b>\n    <table id=\"tableSampleCraftedItems\" cellSpacing=\"0\" className=\"right\">\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th align=\"left\">\nItem\n          </th>\n          <th align=\"left\">\nMarket Price\n          </th>\n          <th align=\"left\">\nCraft Cost\n          </th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tfoot>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"3\">\n            <ol>\n              <li>Does not require a Craft feat.\n              </li>\n              <li>The market prices and craft costs for these items assume that\nyou already have the masterwork item to be enhanced.\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tfoot>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nArrows, 100<sup>1</sup>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n10 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n5 gp, 1 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nAcid\n          </td>\n          <td>\n10 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n5 gp,1 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nChainmail<sup>1</sup>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n20 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n10 gp, 2 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nLock, simple<sup>1</sup>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n20 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n10 gp, 2 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nScroll of cure light wounds\n          </td>\n          <td>\n25 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n12.5 gp, 1 XP, 2 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nGreatsword<sup>1</sup>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n50 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n25 gp, 5 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nMasterwork chainmail\n          </td>\n          <td>\n170 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n85 gp, 17 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nPotion of cure moderate wounds\n          </td>\n          <td>\n300 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n150 gp, 6 XP, 30 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nMasterwork greatsword\n          </td>\n          <td>\n350 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n175 gp, 35 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n+ 1 chainmail<sup>2</sup>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,000 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n500 gp, 40 XP, 100 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nRing of protection + 1\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2,000 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,000 gp, 80 XP, 200 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n+1 greatsword<sup>2</sup>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2,000 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,000 gp, 80 XP, 200 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nWand of fireball\n          </td>\n          <td>\n11,250 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n5,625 gp, 450 XP, 1,125 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nGloves of Dexterity +4\n          </td>\n          <td>\n16,000 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n8,000 gp, 640 XP, 1,600 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n+5 chainmail<sup>2</sup>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n25,000 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n12,500 gp, 1,000 XP, 2,500 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n+5 greatsword<sup>2</sup>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n50,000 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n25,000 gp, 2,000 XP, 5,000 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nRobe of the archmagi\n          </td>\n          <td>\n75,000 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n37,500 gp, 3,000 XP, 7,500 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nTome of understanding +5\n          </td>\n          <td>\n137,500 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n68,750 gp, 5,500 XP, 13,750 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nStaff of power\n          </td>\n          <td>\n200,000 gp\n          </td>\n          <td>\n100,000 gp, 8,000 XP, 20,000 craft\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p><i>Example One:</i>\nA masterwork suit of full plate armor has a market price of 1,650 gp.

If\nyou wanted, you could save 200 craft points by spending two 8-hour days\nworking on the item.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"assisting\"></a>\nASSISTING\n    </h5>\nIn addition to the primary crafter who must have the appropriate Craft\nfeat up to three assistants can contribute craft points to the creation of\nthe item.\n    <p>\nAssistants who have the appropriate Craft feat contribute craft points at\nfull normal value. For untrained assistants (those who don't have the\nappropriate Craft feat), each craft point contributed counts as 1/2 point\nof assistance.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThe primary creator must contribute at least half of the craft points\nrequired to create an item.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIt doesn't matter who contributes the gold piece cost that goes toward\ncreating the item. Only the primary creator can contribute experience\npoints toward the creation of a magic item.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor example, Kroh has 1,000 gp and a masterwork sword, and wants to help\nKlamzo imbue the sword with a +1 enhancement bonus (turning it\ninto a +1 longsword). This task would normally cost 200 craft points.\nKlamzo must supply at least half of this, or 100. Kroh doesn't have <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#craft-magic-arms-and-armor\">Craft\nMagic Arms and Armor</a>, so he must spend twice as many craft points to\nachieve the same contribution. Assuming he's the only assistant, he could\ncontribute up to half the effort required to achieve the goal (100 craft\npoints). Since his craft points only count for half value, he has to spend\n200 craft points to contribute 100 points worth of value. When those 200\npoints are added to Klamzo's contribution, the gold pieces spent on\nmaterials, and the masterwork longsword, the process is complete.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf Freeble (also untrained) assisted Klamzo as well, the two assistants\ncombined could still contribute no more than the equivalent of 100 craft\npoints (half the total craft point cost). However, each would have to\nspend only 100 craft points (50 points of value each) to achieve this\ngoal.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"gaining-craft-points\"></a>\nGAINING CRAFT POINTS\n    </h5>\nA 1st-level character has 100 craft points. With each class level gained,\nhe gains a number of craft points equal to his new level � 100. A\n2nd-level character can have as many as 300 craft points, and so forth,\nall the way up to a 20th-level character, who would have a total of 21,000\ncraft points (assuming he never spent any).\n    <p>\nCreatures with Intelligence of 3 or higher have craft points as a\ncharacter whose level equals their class levels + Hit Dice. A <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersMtoN.html#night-hag\">night nag</a> (8 HD), for instance, has the\ncraft points of an 8th-level character. If that night nag gained a class level, it would\ngain an additional 900 craft points. Of course, not all creatures can use\ntheir craft points � despite being at least reasonably intelligent, a\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersG.html#griffon\">griffon</a> or <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersOtoR.html#pegasus\">pegasus</a> is unlikely to be in a position to craft an item or\nassist another character in crafting an item. The Game Master must use his\nbest judgment when determining whether a creature can use its craft\npoints.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nCreatures with Intelligence of 2 or lower (or without an Intelligence\nscore) never gain craft points.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFamiliars or special mounts never gain craft points, regardless of their\nintelligence or Hit Dice.\n    </p>\n    <a id=\"table-craft-points-gained-by-level\"></a><b>Table: Craft Points Gained By Level</b>\n    <table cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th align=\"left\">\nCharacter\nLevel\n          </th>\n          <th align=\"left\">\nCraft Points\nGained\n          </th>\n          <th align=\"left\">\nTotal\nCraft Points<sup>1</sup>\n          </th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tfoot>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"3\">\n            <ol>\n              <li>Subtract any craft points already spent from this total, and\nadd any craft points gained from feats.\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tfoot>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n1st\n          </td>\n          <td>\n100\n          </td>\n          <td>\n100\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n2nd\n          </td>\n          <td>\n200\n          </td>\n          <td>\n300\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n3rd\n          </td>\n          <td>\n300\n          </td>\n          <td>\n600\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n4th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n400\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,000\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n5th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n500\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,500\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n6th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n600\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2,100\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n7th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n700\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2,800\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n8th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n800\n          </td>\n          <td>\n3,600\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n9th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n900\n          </td>\n          <td>\n4,500\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n10th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,000\n          </td>\n          <td>\n5,500\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n11th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,100\n          </td>\n          <td>\n6,600\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n12th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,200\n          </td>\n          <td>\n7,800\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n13th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,300\n          </td>\n          <td>\n9,100\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n14th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,400\n          </td>\n          <td>\n10,500\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n15th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,500\n          </td>\n          <td>\n12,000\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n16th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,600\n          </td>\n          <td>\n13,600\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n17th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,700\n          </td>\n          <td>\n15,300\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n18th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,800\n          </td>\n          <td>\n17,100\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\n19th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n1,900\n          </td>\n          <td>\n19,000\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n20th\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2,000\n          </td>\n          <td>\n21,000\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <h5><a id=\"item-creation-feats\"></a>\nITEM CRATION FEATS\n    </h5>\nEach time you gain an item creation feat, you gain additional craft points\nas noted on <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#table-item-creation-feats\">Table: Item Creation Feats</a>.
