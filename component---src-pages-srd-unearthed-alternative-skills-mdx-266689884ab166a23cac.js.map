It is, however, a detailed part of the d20 game\nsystem and a place where you'll often spend a considerable amount of time\nif you create detailed PCs, NPCs, or monsters to use in your game. The\nvariant skill systems discussed here eliminate some of the complexity of\nthe standard skill system, but at the expense of fewer opportunities for\ncustomization.\n    <h5><a id=\"maximum-ranks-limited-choices\"></a>\nMAXIMUM RANKS, LIMITED CHOICES\n    </h5>\nThis variant skill system allows for some customization during character\ncreation and during character advancement. It allows for more up-front\nchoices and fewer down the road. In general, this system works for players\nand game masters who want the versatility of the skill system but don't\nwant to worry about counting up every skill points and adjusting skills\nevery level. It's particularly useful for game masters who are creating\nNPCs from scratch.\n    <p>\nEssentially, this system treats each skill as either a known skill or an\nunknown skill. A character is considered to have the maximum number of\nranks allowable in any skill known to that character, and no ranks in any\nskill unknown to that character.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"learning-skills\"></a>\nLearning Skills\n    </h6>\n    <p>\nEach character begins play knowing a number of skills equal to the number\nof skill points his character would gain with each new class level. When\ncreating a character, choose a number of skills known based on your first\nclass level (see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-skills-by-class\">Table: Skills by Class</a>). Human characters add one to\ntheir number of known skills.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor classes or monster types not listed on the table, simply assign a\nnumber of skills known equal to the number of skill points gained at each\nnew level or Hit Dice, plus the character's or monsters intelligence\nmodifier.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nNote whether each skill known is a class skill or cross-class skill for\nyour character, based on his starting class.\n    </p>\n    <a id=\"table-skills-by-class\"></a><b>Table: Skills By Class</b>\n    <table cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>\nClass\n          </th>\n          <th>\nNumber of Skills Known<sup>1</sup>\n          </th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tfoot>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"2\">\n            <ol>\n              <li>Minimum of one skill known, regardless of Intelligence\npenalty.\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tfoot>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nBarbarian\n          </td>\n          <td>\n4 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nBard\n          </td>\n          <td>\n6 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nCleric\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nDruid\n          </td>\n          <td>\n4 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nFighter\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nMonk\n          </td>\n          <td>\n4 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nPaladin\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nRanger\n          </td>\n          <td>\n6 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nRogue\n          </td>\n          <td>\n8 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\nSorcerer\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>\nWizard\n          </td>\n          <td>\n2 + Int modifier\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>\nFor example, Fnord the gnome bard has an Intelligence of 12 (+1 bonus) and\nthus may know seven skills at 1st level. He selects the following seven\nskills (and denotes <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#forgery\">Forgery</a> as a cross-class skill):\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#perform\">Perform</a> (string instruments),\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#spellcraft\">Spellcraft</a>,\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#use-magic-device\">Use Magic Device</a>,\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#gather-information\">Gather Information</a>,\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#listen\">Listen</a>,\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#decipher-script\">Decipher Script</a>, and\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#forgery\">Forgery</a> (cc)</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"skill-modifiers\"></a>\nSkill Modifiers\n    </h6>\nFor each of your known skills, your modifier is calculated as if you had\nthe maximum number of ranks allowable in that skill. For a class skill,\nthe skill modifier is equal to your character level +3; for a cross-class\nskill, the modifier is half that number, rounded down.\n    <p>\nAs with a normal skill\ncheck, you also add any other modifiers that apply (racial bonuses,\nability modifiers, bonuses from synergy, and so forth).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor example, at 5th level, Fnord has a Charisma of 16 and a masterwork\nlute. When he makes a <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#perform\">Perform</a> (string instruments) check, he uses this\nformula:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\n1d20 + 8 (class skill) + 3 (Cha modifier) + 1 (masterwork lute)\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\nWhen he makes a <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#forgery\">Forgery</a> check, the formula changes to reflect the fact\nthat Forgery is a cross-class skill:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\n1d20 + 4 (cross-class skill) + 1 (Int modifier)\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\nSkills that don't have ranks, such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#speak-language\">Speak Language</a>, work differently. A\ncharacter who chooses Speak Language as a known skill learns four new\nlanguages at 1st level and one new language at each level thereafter (if\nSpeak Language is a class skill) or two new languages at 1st level and one\nnew language at each odd-numbered level thereafter (if Speak Language is a\ncross-class skill).\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"prerequisites-and-minimum-skill-ranks\"></a>\nPrerequisites and Minimum Skill Ranks\n    </h6>\nIf you need to determine how many ranks your character has in a skill (for\npurposes of meeting prerequisites for prestige class or feat requirements,\nor for any other reason), simply assume you have the maximum number of\nranks you could have in any of the skills you know. For class skills,\nthat's always your character level +3, and for cross-class skills it's\nhalf that total (rounded down).\n    <p>\nFor example, to use the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"bard.html#song-of-freedom\">song of freedom</a> bardic music ability, Fnord must\nbe at least 12th level and have at least 15 ranks in a <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#perform\">Perform</a> skill.\nSince Perform is a class skill for bards, and Fnord has selected Perform\n(string instruments) as one of his skills, he is treated as having the\nmaximum possible ranks in Perform (string instruments). Thus, by 12th\nlevel, he is considered to have 15 ranks in Perform (string instruments).\nAt the same time, he is considered to have only 7 ranks in <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#forgery\">Forgery</a> (a\ncross-class skill).\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"multiclass-characters\"></a>\nMulticlass Characters\n    </h6>\nMulticlassing under this variant system is a little more complex than in\nthe normal rules and does not achieve the same results as single classing\nwould.\n    <p>\nFirst, compare your current list of known skills to your new class's list\nof class skills. If any of your new class's class skills are currently\nknown by you as cross-class skills, you may choose one such skill and\ndesignate it as a class skill. This change immediately increases your\nmodifier for the chosen skill (see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#skill-modifiers\">Skill Modifiers</a>, above). Every time you\ngain a level in this new class, you may choose another such skill, if\napplicable, and change it from a cross-class skill to a class skill.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSecond, compare your new class's number of skills known at 1st level to\nthe number of skills known 1st level from the class you already have. If\nyou already have more than one class, compare it to the class that would\ngrant the highest number of skills, even if that wasn't your first class.\nFor example, if you are playing a 2nd-level rogue/5th-level fighter and\npick up a level of barbarian, use the rogue's number of skills (8), even\nthough you have more fighter levels than rogue levels.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf your new class grants an equal or lower number of skills, you can\nchoose one skill from your new class's list to add to the skills you know\nas a class skill. You immediately gain the new skill at the maximum\npossible tank.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf your new class grants you up to four more skills than your best\nprevious class, you may choose two skills from your new class's list to\nadd to the skills you know as class skills. You immediately gain the two\nnew skills at the maximum possible rank.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf your new class grants you five or more skills over and above your best\nclass, you may choose three skills from your new class's list to add to\nthe skills you know as class skills. You immediately gain the three new\nskills at the maximum possible rank.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nPerform this operation every time you gain 1st level in a new class.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThis system reflects the idea that by multiclassing, you learn more\nabilities and, in particular, skills. Most characters do end up with\nhigher numbers of skills and ranks if they multiclass under this variant\nsystem, but they still have fewer skill choices.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"learning-new-skills\"></a>\nLearning New Skills\n    </h6>\nIf you are not interested in multiclassing but wish to learn new skills\nanyway, you have two options.\n    <p>\nIf you increase your Intelligence modifier, you learn one additional\nskill. Make this skill choice using the class skill list of any of your\nexisting classes. You can choose a class skill or a cross-class skill.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAlternatively, your game master can allow the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#skill-knowledge\">Skill Knowledge</a> feat, which increases your\ncharacters number of known skills.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"level-based-skills\"></a>\nLEVEL-BASED SKILLS\n    </h5>\nThis even simpler variant system assumes that skills are much less\nimportant in your game and that you really don't want to be bothered with\ntracking or even looking for skill ranks over the course\nof a fast-paced game session.\n    <h6><a id=\"making-skill-checks\"></a>\nMaking Skill Checks\n    </h6>\nUnder this system, characters do not normally acquire skill ranks or track skill\npoints at all. Each character has a list of known skills that includes all\nhis class skills (from all classes).\n    <p>\nWhen a character makes a skill check under this\nvariant skill system, use these formulas:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\n        <b>Class Skills:</b> 1d20 + character level + modifiers\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>Cross-Class Skills:</b> 1d20 + modifiers\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\nHere, the trade-off for simplicity is ability. Characters with a large\nnumber of class skills are extremely versatile, but even their average\nskill check result\nis lower than that made by a character using the existing skill system.\nFor skills outside their areas of expertise (cross-class skills), they\nhave nothing beyond their own basic abilities and perhaps magic or other\nbonuses.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nUnder this system, all barbarians are good at climbing, jumping,\nlistening, riding, and the like, but have virtually no ability to bluff,\nhide, search, or perform other cross-class tasks. Monks become superior\nacrobats (with talent in balancing, climbing, jumping, and tumbling) but\nno proficiency at anything outside the idiom of the typical monk (such as\ndisguise or survival).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA character who wishes to specialize or branch out her skill knowledge can\nstill select feats such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#skill-focus\">Skill Focus</a>, <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#alertness\">Alertness</a>, and the like,\nregardless of whether the skills affected by the feat are class skills or\ncross-class skills. This is the best avenue for a fighter who wishes to\nimprove his awareness, a wizard who wants to become intimidating, and so\non.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSkills that don't have ranks, such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#speak-language\">Speak Language</a>, work differently. A\ncharacter who has Speak Language as a class skill learns four new\nlanguages at 1st level and one new language at each level thereafter.\nCharacters without Speak Language as a class skill can't learn new\nlanguages without selecting the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#skill-knowledge\">Skill Knowledge</a> feat and designating Speak\nLanguage as a class skill.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"multiclassing\"></a>\nMulticlassing\n    </h6>\nSince skills are not as important in a game that uses this system (at\nleast, that's the intention), when a character multiclasses, combine the\nskill lists. Consider all skills on both lists as class skills.\n    <h6><a id=\"learning-new-level-based-skills\"></a>\nLearning New Skills\n    </h6>\nAs with the maximum ranks variant described earlier, the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#skill-knowledge\">Skill Knowledge</a>\nfeat (see below) can be selected by a character to add to his number of\nskills known. In this case, the feat only allows you to designate a\ncross-class skill as a class skill (since you already know all your class\nskills).\n    <h5><a id=\"skill-knowledge\"></a>\nSkILL KNOWLEDGE [GENERAL]\n    </h5>\nYou gain access to new knowledge and abilities.\n    <p><b>Benefit:</b> Choose any two skills from one of your current classes' skill lists. You\nnow know these skills as class skills.\n    </p>\n    <p><b>Special:</b> Instead of choosing two class skills, you may choose one cross-class skill\n(whether you already know it or not) and learn it, treating it as a class\nskill from that point forward.\n    </p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
