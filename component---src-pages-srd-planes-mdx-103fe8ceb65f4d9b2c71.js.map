different\nrealities with interwoven connections. Except for rare linking points,\neach plane is effectively its own universe with its own natural laws. </p>\n    <p>The planes break down into a number of general types: the\nMaterial Plane, the Transitive Planes, the Inner Planes, the Outer\nPlanes, and the demiplanes.</p>\n    <a id=\"what-is-a-material-plane\"></a><p><b>Material Plane</b>: The Material Plane tends to be the most\nEarthlike of all planes and operates under the same set of natural laws\nthat our own real world does. This is the default plane for most\nadventures.</p>\n    <a id=\"what-are-transitive-planes\"></a><p><b>Transitive Planes</b>: These three planes have one\nimportant common characteristic: Each is used to get from one place to\nanother. The Astral Plane is a conduit to all other planes, while the\nEthereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow both serve as means of\ntransportation within the Material Plane they&#8217;re connected to. These\nplanes have the strongest regular interaction with the Material Plane\nand are often accessed by using various spells. They have native\ninhabitants as well.</p>\n    <a id=\"waht-are-inner-planes\"></a><p><b>Inner Planes</b>: These six planes are manifestations of\nthe basic building blocks of the universe. Each is made up of a single\ntype of energy or element that overwhelms all others. The natives of a\nparticular Inner Plane are made of the same energy or element as the\nplane itself.</p>\n    <a id=\"what-are-outer-planes\"></a><p><b>Outer Planes</b>: The deities live on the Outer Planes, as\ndo creatures such as celestials, demons, and devils. Each of the Outer\nPlanes has an alignment, representing a particular moral or ethical\noutlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave in agreement with\nthat plane&#8217;s alignment. The Outer Planes are also the final resting\nplace of souls from the Material Plane, whether that final rest takes\nthe form of calm introspection or eternal damnation.</p>\n    <a id=\"what-are-demiplanes\"></a><p><b>Demiplanes</b>: This catch-all category covers all\nextradimensional spaces that function like planes but have measurable\nsize and limited access. Other kinds of planes are theoretically\ninfinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet\nacross.</p>\n    <a id=\"planar-traits\"></a><h5>PLANAR TRAITS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Each plane of existence has its own\nproperties&#8212;the natural laws of its universe.</p>\n    <p>Planar traits are broken down into a number of general areas.\nAll planes have the following kinds of traits.</p>\n    <p><b>Physical Traits</b>: These traits determine the laws of\nphysics and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time\nfunction.</p>\n    <p><b>Elemental and Energy Traits</b>: These traits determine the\ndominance of particular elemental or energy forces.</p>\n    <p><b>Alignment Traits</b>: Just as characters may be lawful\nneutral or chaotic good, many planes are tied to a particular moral or\nethical outlook.</p>\n    <p><b>Magic Traits</b>: Magic works differently from plane to\nplane, and magic traits set the boundaries for what it can and can&#8217;t do.</p>\n    <a id=\"physical-traits\"></a><h6>Physical Traits</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The two most important natural laws set by\nphysical traits are how gravity works and how time passes. Other\nphysical traits pertain to the size and shape of a plane and how easily\na plane&#8217;s nature can be altered.</p>\n    <a id=\"gravity\"></a><p><b>Gravity</b>: The direction of gravity&#8217;s pull may be\nunusual, and it might even change directions within the plane itself.</p>\n    <a id=\"normal-gravity\"></a><p><i>Normal Gravity</i>: Most planes have gravity similar to\nthat of the Material Plane. The usual rules for ability scores,\ncarrying capacity, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise noted in a\ndescription, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.</p>\n    <a id=\"heavy-gravity\"></a><p><i>Heavy Gravity</i>: The gravity on a plane with this trait\nis much more intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, <a href=\"skillsAll.html#balance\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Balance</a>,\n      <a href=\"skillsAll.html#climb\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Climb</a>,\n      <a href=\"skillsAll.html#jump\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Jump</a>,\n      <a href=\"skillsAll.html#ride\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Ride</a>,\n      <a href=\"skillsAll.html#swim\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Swim</a>,\nand <a href=\"skillsAll.html#tumble\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Tumble</a>\nchecks incur a &#8211;2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack\nrolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a\ncharacter&#8217;s speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character&#8217;s Strength and\nDexterity scores are not affected.</p>\n    <p>Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points\nof damage for each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of\ndamage.</p>\n    <a id=\"light.gravity\"></a><p><i>Light Gravity</i>: The gravity on a plane with this trait\nis less intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, creatures find\nthat they can lift more, but their movements tend to be ungainly.\nCharacters on a plane with the light gravity trait take a &#8211;2\ncircumstance penalty on attack rolls and Balance, Ride, Swim, and\nTumble checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and\ncharacters gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb and Jump checks.\nStrength and Dexterity don&#8217;t change as a result of light gravity, but\nwhat you can do with such scores does change. These advantages apply to\ntravelers from other planes as well as natives.</p>\n    <p>Falling characters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of\ndamage for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4).</p>\n    <a id=\"no-gravity\"></a><p><i>No Gravity</i>: Individuals on a plane with this trait\nmerely float in space, unless other resources are available to provide\na direction for gravity&#8217;s pull.</p>\n    <a id=\"objective-directional-gravity\"></a><p><i>Objective Directional Gravity</i>: The strength of gravity\non a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but\nthe direction is not the traditional &#8220;down&#8221; toward the ground. It may\nbe down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of the\nplane itself, or even upward.</p>\n    <p>In addition, objective directional gravity may change from\nplace to place. The direction of &#8220;down&#8221; may vary.</p>\n    <a id=\"subjective-directional-gravity\"></a><p><i>Subjective Directional Gravity</i>: The strength of gravity\non a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but\neach individual chooses the direction of gravity&#8217;s pull. Such a plane\nhas no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures. This\nsort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is\ncommon on &#8220;weightless&#8221; planes.</p>\n    <p>Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can\nmove normally along a solid surface by imagining &#8220;down&#8221; near their\nfeet. If suspended in midair, a character &#8220;flies&#8221; by merely choosing a\n&#8220;down&#8221; direction and &#8220;falling&#8221; that way. Under such a procedure, an\nindividual &#8220;falls&#8221; 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in each\nsucceeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to stop, one\nhas to slow one&#8217;s movement by changing the designated &#8220;down&#8221; direction\n(again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300\nfeet per round thereafter).</p>\n    <p>It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of\ngravity as a free action; this check can be made once per round. Any\ncharacter who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a\n+6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or she succeeds.</p>\n    <a id=\"time\"></a><p><b>Time</b>: The rate of time&#8217;s passage can vary on different\nplanes, though it remains constant within any particular plane. Time is\nalways subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to\nvarious planes. Travelers may discover that they&#8217;ll pick up or lose\ntime while moving among the planes, but from their point of view, time\nalways passes naturally.</p>\n    <a id=\"normal-time\"></a><p><i>Normal Time</i>: This trait describes the way time passes\non the Material Plane. One hour on a plane with normal time equals one\nhour on the Material Plane. Unless otherwise noted in a description,\nevery plane has the normal time trait.</p>\n    <a id=\"timeless\"></a><p><i>Timeless</i>: On planes with this trait, time still passes,\nbut the effects of time are diminished. How the timeless trait can\naffect certain activities or conditions such as hunger, thirst, aging,\nthe effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane.</p>\n    <p>The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a\nplane for one where time flows normally, conditions such as hunger and\naging do occur retroactively. </p>\n    <a id=\"flowing-time\"></a><p><i>Flowing Time</i>: On some planes, time can flow faster or\nslower. One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, then\nreturn to the Material Plane to find that only six seconds have\nelapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds\nolder. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working\non him, that year away was entirely real.</p>\n    <p>When designating how time works on planes with flowing time,\nput the Material Plane&#8217;s flow of time first, followed by the same flow\nin the other plane. </p>\n    <a id=\"erratic-time\"></a><p><i>Erratic Time</i>: Some planes have time that slows down and\nspeeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he moves between\nthe two planes. The following is provided as an example.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-erratic-time\"></a><table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"400px\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr valign=\"bottom\">\n          <th>d%</th>\n          <th>Time on\nMaterial Plane</th>\n          <th>Time on\nErratic Time Plane</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>01&#8211;10</td>\n          <td>1 day</td>\n          <td>1 round</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>11&#8211;40</td>\n          <td>1 day</td>\n          <td>1 hour</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>41&#8211;60</td>\n          <td>1 day</td>\n          <td>1 day</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>61&#8211;90</td>\n          <td>1 hour</td>\n          <td>1 day</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>91&#8211;100</td>\n          <td>1 round</td>\n          <td>1 day</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>To the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the\nshift is unnoticed.</p>\n    <p>If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast\nwith a noninstantaneous duration is permanent until dispelled.</p>\n    <a id=\"shape-and-size\"></a><p><b>Shape and Size</b>: Planes come in a variety of sizes and\nshapes. Most planes are infinite, or at least so large that they may as\nwell be infinite.</p>\n    <a id=\"infinite\"></a><p><i>Infinite</i>: Planes with this trait go on forever, though\nthey may have finite components within them. Or they may consist of\nongoing expanses in two directions, like a map that stretches out\ninfinitely.</p>\n    <a id=\"finite-shape\"></a><p><i>Finite Shape</i>: A plane with this trait has defined edges\nor borders. These borders may adjoin other planes or hard, finite\nborders such as the edge of the world or a great wall. Demiplanes are\noften finite.</p>\n    <a id=\"self-contained-shape\"></a><p><i>Self-Contained Shape</i>: On planes with this trait, the\nborders wrap in on themselves, depositing the traveler on the other\nside of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a self-contained,\nfinite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat planes with\nmagical edges that teleport the traveler to an opposite edge when he\ncrosses them. </p>\n    <p>Some demiplanes are self-contained.</p>\n    <a id=\"morphic-traits\"></a><p><b>Morphic Traits</b>: This trait measures how easily the\nbasic nature of a plane can be changed. Some planes are responsive to\nsentient thought, while others can be manipulated only by extremely\npowerful creatures. And some planes respond to physical or magical\nefforts.</p>\n    <a id=\"alterable-morphic\"></a><p><i>Alterable Morphic</i>: On a plane with this trait, objects\nremain where they are (and what they are) unless affected by physical\nforce or magic. You can change the immediate environment as a result of\ntangible effort. </p>\n    <a id=\"highly-morphic\"></a><p><i>Highly Morphic</i>: On a plane with this trait, features of\nthe plane change so frequently that it&#8217;s difficult to keep a particular\narea stable. Such planes may react dramatically to specific spells,\nsentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for no reason. </p>\n    <a id=\"magically-morphic\"></a><p><i>Magically Morphic</i>: Specific spells can alter the basic\nmaterial of a plane with this trait.</p>\n    <a id=\"divinely-morphic\"></a><p><i>Divinely Morphic</i>: Specific unique beings (deities or\nsimilar great powers) have the ability to alter objects, creatures, and\nthe landscape on planes with this trait. Ordinary characters find these\nplanes similar to alterable planes in that they may be affected by\nspells and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas to\nchange instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for\nthemselves. </p>\n    <a id=\"static\"></a><p><i>Static</i>: These planes are unchanging. Visitors cannot\naffect living residents of the plane, nor objects that the denizens\npossess. Any spells that would affect those on the plane have no effect\nunless the plane&#8217;s static trait is somehow removed or suppressed.\nSpells cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain in\neffect, however.</p>\n    <p>Even moving an unattended object within a static plane\nrequires a DC 16 Strength check. Particularly heavy objects may be\nimpossible to move.</p>\n    <a id=\"sentient\"></a><p><i>Sentient</i>: These planes are ones that respond to a\nsingle thought&#8212; that of the plane itself. Travelers would find the\nplane&#8217;s landscape changing as a result of what the plane thought of the\ntravelers, either becoming more or less hospitable depending on its\nreaction.</p>\n    <a id=\"elemental-and-energy-traits\"></a><h6>Elemental and Energy Traits</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Four basic elements and two types of energy\ntogether make up everything. The elements are earth, air, fire, and\nwater. The types of energy are positive and negative.</p>\n    <p>The Material Plane reflects a balancing of those elements and\nenergies; all are found there. Each of the Inner Planes is dominated by\none element or type of energy. Other planes may show off various\naspects of these elemental traits. Many planes have no elemental or\nenergy traits; these traits are noted in a plane&#8217;s description only\nwhen they are present.</p>\n    <a id=\"air-dominant\"></a><p><b>Air-Dominant</b>: Mostly open space, planes with this trait\nhave just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They usually\nhave a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of\nacidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable\non air-dominant planes because they have little or no natural earth to\nconnect with. They take no actual damage, however.</p>\n    <a id=\"earth-dominant\"></a><p><b>Earth-Dominant</b>: Planes with this trait are mostly\nsolid. Travelers who arrive run the risk of suffocation if they don&#8217;t\nreach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals\nwithout the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig\ntheir way out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are\nuncomfortable on earth dominant planes because these planes are tight\nand claustrophobic to them. But they suffer no inconvenience beyond\nhaving difficulty moving.</p>\n    <a id=\"fire-dominant\"></a><p><b>Fire-Dominant</b>: Planes with this trait are composed of\nflames that continually burn without consuming their fuel source.\nFire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to Material Plane creatures,\nand those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.\nUnprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch\nfire almost immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable\nclothing catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of\nfire damage every round they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of\nthe water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant planes.\nThose that are made of water take double damage each round.</p>\n    <a id=\"water-dominant\"></a><p><b>Water-Dominant</b>: Planes with this trait are mostly\nliquid. Visitors who can&#8217;t breathe water or reach a pocket of air will\nlikely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable\non water-dominant planes. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage\neach round.</p>\n    <a id=\"positive-dominant\"></a><p><b>Positive-Dominant</b>: An abundance of life characterizes\nplanes with this trait. The two kinds of positive-dominant traits are\nminor positive-dominant and major positive-dominant.</p>\n    <p>A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of life\nin all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are\nlouder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive\nenergy swirling through the plane. All individuals in a\npositive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2 as an extraordinary ability.</p>\n    <p>Major positive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on\na major positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to\navoid being <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>blinded</a> for 10 rounds by the\nbrilliance of the\nsurroundings. Simply being on the plane grants fast healing 5 as an\nextraordinary ability. In addition, those at full hit points gain 5\nadditional temporary hit points per round. These temporary hit points\nfade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive- dominant\nplane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round\nthat its temporary hit points exceed its normal hit point total.\nFailing the saving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of\nenergy, killing it.</p>\n    <a id=\"negative-dominant\"></a><p><b>Negative-Dominant</b>: Planes with this trait are vast,\nempty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them. They\ntend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and filled with\nwinds bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with\npositive-dominant planes, negative-dominant planes can be either minor\nor major. On minor negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6\npoints of damage per round. At 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into\nash.</p>\n    <p>Major negative-dominant planes are even more severe. Each\nround, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative\nlevel. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or Hit\nDice is slain, becoming a wraith.</p>\n    <p>The death ward spell protects a traveler from the damage and <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#enegy-drained\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>energy drain</a> of a\nnegative-dominant plane.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"alignment-traits\"></a>Alignment Traits</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Some planes have a predisposition to a certain\nalignment. Most of the inhabitants of these planes also have the\nplane&#8217;s particular alignment, even powerful creatures such as deities.\nIn addition, creatures of alignments contrary to the plane have a\ntougher time dealing with its natives and situations.</p>\n    <p>The alignment trait of a plane affects social interactions\nthere. Characters who follow other alignments than most of the\ninhabitants do may find life more difficult.</p>\n    <p>Alignment traits have multiple components. First are the moral\n(good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic) components; a plane can\nhave either a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each.\nSecond, the specific alignment trait indicates whether each moral or\nethical component is mildly or strongly evident.</p>\n    <a id=\"good-aligned-evil-aligned\"></a><p><b>Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned</b>: These planes have chosen a\nside in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be both\ngood-aligned and evil-aligned.</p>\n    <a id=\"law-aligned-chaos-aligned\"></a><p><b>Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned</b>: Law versus chaos is the key\nstruggle for these planes and their residents. No plane can be both\nlaw-aligned and chaos-aligned.</p>\n    <p>Each part of the moral/ethical alignment trait has a\ndescriptor, either &#8220;mildly&#8221; or &#8220;strongly,&#8221; to show how powerful the\ninfluence of alignment is on the plane.</p>\n    <a id=\"mildly-aligned\"></a><p><b>Mildly Aligned</b>: Creatures who have an alignment\nopposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a &#8211;2 circumstance penalty\non all Charisma-based checks.</p>\n    <a id=\"strongly-aligned\"></a><p><b>Strongly Aligned</b>: On planes that are strongly aligned,\na &#8211;2 circumstance penalty applies on all Charisma-based checks made by\nall creatures not of the plane&#8217;s alignment. In addition, the &#8211;2 penalty\naffects all Intelligence-based and Wisdom-based checks, too.</p>\n    <p>The penalties for the moral and ethical components of the\nalignment trait do stack.</p>\n    <a id=\"neutral-aligned\"></a><p><b>Neutral-Aligned</b>: A mildly neutral-aligned plane does\nnot apply a circumstance penalty to anyone.</p>\n    <p>The Material Plane is considered mildly neutral-aligned,\nthough it may contain high concentrations of evil or good, law or chaos\nin places.</p>\n    <p>A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to\nall other moral and ethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos.\nSuch a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the alignments\nthan with accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the\nsame fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly\nneutral-aligned planes apply a &#8211;2 circumstance penalty to\nIntelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based checks by any creature that\nisn&#8217;t neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and\nonce for good/evil), so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and\nchaotic neutral creatures take a &#8211;2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic\ngood, chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a &#8211;4 penalty.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-traits\"></a><h6>Magic Traits</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A plane&#8217;s magic trait describes how magic\nworks on the plane compared to how it works on the Material Plane.\nParticular locations on a plane (such as those under the direct control\nof deities) may be pockets where a different magic trait applies.</p>\n    <a id=\"normal-magic\"></a><p><b>Normal Magic</b>: This magic trait means that all spells\nand supernatural abilities function as written.
