You also can&#8217;t use a\nshield while climbing.</p>\n    <p>Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check\nagainst the DC of the slope or wall.

By accepting a &#8211;5 penalty, you can move half your speed\n(instead of one-quarter your speed).</p>\n    <p><i>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds</i>: You can make\nyour own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing\nso takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of\ndistance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a\nwall with pitons in it has a DC of 15.

Make a Climb\ncheck (DC = wall&#8217;s DC + 20) to do so.

Doing so\nrequires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character\n(though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if\ndesired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC =\nwall&#8217;s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling\ncharacter, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot\nexceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail\nyour Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character&#8217;s fall\nbut don&#8217;t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you\nfail to stop the character&#8217;s fall and begin falling as well.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Climbing is part of movement, so it&#8217;s generally\npart of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement\nin a move action).

If a creature with a climb\nspeed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its\nclimb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a\nsingle Climb check at a &#8211;5 penalty. Such a creature retains its\nDexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents\nget no special bonus to their attacks against it.

A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion\nyou need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check\nas part of movement, so it doesn&#8217;t take a separate action.
