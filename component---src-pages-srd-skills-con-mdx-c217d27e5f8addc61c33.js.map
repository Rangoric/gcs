Such actions include casting a spell,\nconcentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like\nability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity.\nIn general, if an action wouldn&#8217;t normally provoke an attack of\nopportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being\ndistracted.</p>\n    <p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the\naction as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails\nand is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell\nis lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends\nas if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a\nspell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were\nusing a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill\nuse also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other\nramifications as well.</p>\n    <p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that\ncause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs\nwhile you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the\nspell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If\nmore than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each\none; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not\ncompleted.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Concentration DC<sup>1</sup></th>\n          <th>Distraction</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>10 + damage dealt</td>\n          <td>Damaged during the action.<sup>2</sup></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>10 + half of continuous</td>\n          <td>Taking continuous damage during the damage last dealt\naction.<sup>3</sup></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Distracting spell&#8217;s save DC</td>\n          <td>Distracted by nondamaging spell.<sup>4</sup></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>10</td>\n          <td>Vigorous motion (on a moving mount, taking a bouncy\nwagon ride, in a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a stormtossed\nship).</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>15</td>\n          <td>Violent motion (on a galloping horse, taking a very\nrough wagon ride, in a small boat in rapids, on the deck of a\nstorm-tossed ship).</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>20</td>\n          <td>Extraordinarily violent motion (earthquake).</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>15</td>\n          <td><a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#entangled\" style={{\n              \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n            }}>Entangled</a>.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>20</td>\n          <td><a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#grappling\" style={{\n              \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n            }}>Grappling</a> or <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#pinned\" style={{\n              \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n            }}>pinned</a>.

Making a Concentration check doesn&#8217;t take\nan action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or\npart of another action (when attempted actively).</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, though a success doesn&#8217;t cancel the\neffect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were\ncasting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use\na spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid\nattacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn&#8217;t apply to other actions\nthat might provoke attacks of opportunity. The DC of the check is 15\n(plus the spell&#8217;s level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like\nability defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may\nattempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of\nopportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn&#8217;t allow you\nto take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you\nmust make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the\nrelated action also automatically fails (with any appropriate\nramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration\nhad been disrupted by a distraction. </p>\n    <p>A character with the <a href=\"featsAll.html#combat-casting\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Combat Casting</a> feat gets a +4\nbonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like\nability while on the defensive or while <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#grappling\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>grappling</a> or <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#pinned\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>pinned</a>.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","style","className","border","cellPadding","cellSpacing","href","colSpan","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
