While operating in a cover identity, the epic infiltra-tor gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks. When the epic infiltrator has the option of adding a new cover identity, he or she may instead work on further perfecting a cover identity already possessed. An improved cover identity grants a +6 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks while operating in that identity. A specific cover identity may be improved multiple times, each time adding +2 to the bonuses. It is impossible to detect the epic infiltrator’s alignment with any form of divination. This ability functions exactly like an undetectable alignment spell, except that it is always active as a supernatural ability. Only divinations are confounded; spells that function only against certain alignments affect the epic infiltrator normally. Should the epic infiltrator wish to “retire” a cover identity and develop a new one, he or she must spend one week practicing the new identity before he or she earns the bonuses. Cover identities do not in themselves provide the epic infiltrator with additional skills, proficiencies, or class features that others might expect of the pretended professions. The epic infiltrator can switch cover identities or don a disguise using the Disguise skill in 1d3 minutes. He or she can also put on or take off armor in one-half the normal time.

Any time the epic infiltrator’s target would be denied his or her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he or she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the epic infiltrator’s attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6 points every three levels. Should the epic infiltrator score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, the epic infiltrator can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage. He or she cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty. An epic infiltrator can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the epic infiltrator must also be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The epic infiltrator cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
