aspects of a character's personality, background, or physique\nthat make him better at some activities and worse at others. In many ways,\ntraits resemble feats: A character can have only a limited number of\ntraits, and each trait provides some benefit. Unlike feats, however,\ntraits always carry a corresponding drawback. In addition to their game\neffects, traits suggest characteristics about the character's personality\nthat might lead to interesting roleplaying opportunities. Together with a\ncharacter's class and feat selection, traits offer a way for game\nmechanics to encourage deeper character backgrounds and consistent\nroleplaying.\n    <p>\nTraits serve as an interesting starting point for roleplaying, reminding\nplayers of their characters' most prominent strengths and weaknesses.\nHowever, roleplaying a certain aspect of a character's personality does\nnot require possessing the trait. For example, a paladin can be honest and\nforthright without the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#honest\">Honest</a> trait. The player should roleplay the\ncharacter consistently even though the character's honesty has no effect\non his skill checks.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA character can begin play with up to two traits, chosen by the player at\nthe time of character creation. Alternatively, the game master can require\nplayers to roll on <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-character-traits\">Table: Character Traits</a> to determine the traits\npossessed by their characters.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAs characters advance in level and ability, they might want to get rid of\nthe traits that they chose at the beginning of play. Although characters\ncannot rid themselves of a trait directly, specific feats, skill ranks, or magic items\ncan compensate for the penalties imposed by a trait. For example, an\nabrasive character can work on becoming more personable by spending skill\npoints to gain a rank in <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#bluff\">Bluff</a> and a rank in <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>, thereby offsetting\nthe drawback from the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#abrasive\">Abrasive</a> trait.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf the game master allows it, players may add traits to their characters\nafter 1st level. The game master might allow a player to assign a trait to\nher character after she has roleplayed the character in a manner\nconsistent with the trait in question, or after a traumatic or life\nchanging experience (after dying, a character might develop the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#cautious\">Cautious</a>\ntrait or the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#aggressive\">Aggressive</a> trait). If the game master includes this option, a\ncharacter should gain a new trait no more frequently than once every five\nlevels.\n    </p>\n    <a id=\"table-character-traits\"></a><b>Table: Character Traits</b>\n    <table cellSpacing=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tfoot>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"5\">\n            <ol>\n              <li>Trait has special restrictions (see the text).

}}>\nAlthough this section provides a large number of character traits, a\nplayer who wants to create a character with a distinctive personality may\nask the game master to design a new trait. If that happens, the game\nmaster should keep in mind that the traits variant is only effective if\nthe benefits and the drawbacks of the traits are related. If the drawback\nand benefit of a trait apply to disparate or unrelated aspects of the\ngame, it becomes too easy for a player to choose a trait for her character\nthat provides a bonus on a commonly attempted ability check or skill check while the\ncorresponding penalty applies to a rarely used or never used aspect of\nplay. For example, a trait that gave a bonus to Armor Class and a penalty\non attack rolls would be poor design because spellcasters make very few attack rolls\n(making the penalty far less severe) yet continuously gain the benefit-of\nthe increased Armor Class.\n      <p>\nAs long as the game master and player talk about a new trait ahead of time\nand view it in light of what skills and abilities the character uses most\noften, this potential pitfall is easy to avoid.\n      </p></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"roleplaying-of-traits\"></a>\nROLEPLAYING OF TRAITS\n    </h5>\nIf a player creates a character with one or more of the traits described\nhere, she has three basic choices for how that trait affects the\ncharacter's personality.\n    <p>\nFirst, the character might view the trait as a weakness. A character with\nthis view might try to hide the trait or make excuses for his behavior. On\nthe other hand, he might seek out others with the trait to feel better\nabout his own idiosyncrasy.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSecond, the character might view the trait as a strength. A character\nmight call attention to the trait, encourage others to act in ways that\nmimic the trait, or simply assume that those without the trait are less\nworthy than those who possess it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFinally, the character might not acknowledge the trait at all. A character\nmight adopt this attitude toward a trait for several reasons, each\nsuggesting something different about the character's background and\npersonality.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>The character might not be aware of the trait; for example, a\nnearsighted character might not realize that others see better at a\ndistance because his impairment is mild and the onset was so gradual that\nhe never noticed the change.\n        </p></li>\n      <li><p>The character might be aware of the trait but not want to admit that\nhe possesses it. For example, an abrasive character might realize that his\nmannerisms affect others, yet find more solace in putting the blame on\nthose whom he offends rather than on himself.\n        </p></li>\n      <li><p>The character might know but simply not care.\n        </p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h5><a id=\"trait-descriptions\"></a>\nTRAIT DESCRIPTIONS\n    </h5>\nEach trait in this section includes a benefit, a drawback, any special\nlimitations regarding its selection by a character, and roleplaying ideas\nfor how to incorporate it into your character's personality.\n    <h6><a id=\"abrasive\"></a>\nAbrasive\n    </h6>\nYou are difficult and demanding in conversation, which tends to oppress\nthose around you.\n    <p><b>Benefit:</b> You gain a +1 bonus on <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#intimidate\">Intimidate</a> checks.\n    </p>\n    <p><b>Drawback:</b> You take a -1 penalty on <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a> checks and <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#bluff\">Bluff</a> checks.\n    </p>\n    <p><b>Roleplaying Ideas:</b> Characters with this trait might be loud and abrupt or quiet and sinister,\nbut either way, most find them disconcerting or irritating.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"absent-minded\"></a>\nAbsent Minded\n    </h6>\nYou are fascinated by knowledge and learning and are capable of pursuing\ncomplex trains of thought quite quickly.
