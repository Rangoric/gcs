If any line\nfrom this corner to any corner of the target&#8217;s square passes through a\nsquare or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or\nthrough a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to\nAC).</p>\n    <p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your\ntarget has cover if any line from your square to the target&#8217;s square\ngoes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack\nagainst a target that isn&#8217;t adjacent to you (such as with a reach\nweapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.</p>\n    <a id=\"low-obstacles-and-cover\"></a><p><b>Low Obstacles and Cover</b>: A low obstacle (such as a wall\nno higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures\nwithin 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if\nhe&#8217;s closer to the obstacle than his target.</p>\n    <a id=\"cover-and-attacks-of-opportunity\"></a><p><b>Cover and Attacks of Opportunity</b>: You can&#8217;t execute an\nattack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.</p>\n    <a id=\"cover-and-reflex-saves\"></a><p><b>Cover and Reflex Saves</b>: Cover grants you a +2 bonus on\nReflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point\non the other side of the cover from you. Note that spread effects can\nextend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.</p>\n    <a id=\"cover-and-hide-checks\"></a><p><b>Cover and Hide Checks</b>: You can use cover to make a Hide\ncheck. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make\na Hide check.</p>\n    <a id=\"soft-cover\"></a><p><b>Soft Cover</b>: Creatures, even your enemies, can provide\nyou with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC.\nHowever, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does\nsoft cover allow you to make a Hide check.</p>\n    <a id=\"big-creatures-and-cover\"></a><p><b>Big Creatures and Cover</b>: Any creature with a space\nlarger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks\nslightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can\nchoose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has\ncover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack\nagainst such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to\ndetermine if it has cover against you.</p>\n    <a id=\"total-cover\"></a><p><b>Total Cover</b>: If you don&#8217;t have line of effect to your\ntarget he is considered to have total cover from you. You can&#8217;t make an\nattack against a target that has total cover.</p>\n    <a id=\"varying-degrees-of-cover\"></a><p><b>Varying Degrees of Cover</b>: In some cases, cover may\nprovide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations the\nnormal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and\n+4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively\ngains improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save\nbonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on Hide\nchecks.</p>\n    <a id=\"concealment\"></a><h5>CONCEALMENT</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">To determine whether your target has\nconcealment from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If\nany line from this corner to any corner of the target&#8217;s square passes\nthrough a square or border that provides concealment, the target has\nconcealment.</p>\n    <p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your\ntarget has concealment if his space is entirely within an effect that\ngrants concealment. When making a melee attack against a target that\nisn&#8217;t adjacent to you use the rules for determining concealment from\nranged attacks.</p>\n    <p>In addition, some magical effects provide concealment against\nall attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.</p>\n    <a id=\"concealment-miss-chance\"></a><p><b>Concealment Miss Chance</b>: Concealment gives the subject\nof a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed because of\nthe concealment. If the attacker hits, the defender must make a miss\nchance percentile roll to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment\nconditions do not stack.</p>\n    <a id=\"concealment-and-hide-checks\"></a><p><b>Concealment and Hide Checks</b>: You can use concealment to\nmake a Hide check. Without concealment, you usually need cover to make\na Hide check.</p>\n    <a id=\"total-concealment\"></a><p><b>Total Concealment</b>: If you have line of effect to a\ntarget but not line of sight he is considered to have total concealment\nfrom you. You can&#8217;t attack an opponent that has total concealment,\nthough you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A\nsuccessful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total\nconcealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss\nchance for an opponent with concealment).</p>\n    <p>You can&#8217;t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent\nwith total concealment, even if you know what square or squares the\nopponent occupies.</p>\n    <a id=\"ignoring-concealment\"></a><p><b>Ignoring Concealment</b>: Concealment isn&#8217;t always\neffective. A shadowy area or darkness doesn&#8217;t provide any concealment\nagainst an opponent with darkvision. Characters with low-light vision\ncan see clearly for a greater distance with the same light source than\nother characters. Although invisibility provides total concealment,\nsighted opponents may still make Spot checks to notice the location of\nan invisible character. An invisible character gains a +20 bonus on\nHide checks if moving, or a +40 bonus on Hide checks when not moving\n(even though opponents can&#8217;t see you, they might be able to figure out\nwhere you are from other visual clues).</p>\n    <a id=\"varying-degrees-of-concealment\"></a><p><b>Varying Degrees of Concealment</b>: Certain situations may\nprovide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss\nchance accordingly.</p>\n    <a id=\"flanking\"></a><h5>FLANKING</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When making a melee attack, you get a +2\nflanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by a character or\ncreature friendly to you on the opponent&#8217;s opposite border or opposite\ncorner.</p>\n    <p>When in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an\nopponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two\nfriendly characters&#8217; centers. If the line passes through opposite\nborders of the opponent&#8217;s space (including corners of those borders),\nthen the opponent is flanked.</p>\n    <p><i>Exception</i>: If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it\ngets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.</p>\n    <p>Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can\nhelp an attacker get a flanking bonus.</p>\n    <p>Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can&#8217;t flank an opponent.</p>\n    <a id=\"helpless-defenders\"></a><h5>HELPLESS DEFENDERS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A helpless opponent is someone who is bound,\nsleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or otherwise at your mercy.</p>\n    <a id=\"helpless-defenders-and-regular-attacks\"></a><p><b>Regular Attack</b>: A helpless character takes a &#8211;4 penalty\nto AC against melee attacks, but no penalty to AC against ranged\nattacks. A helpless defender can&#8217;t use any Dexterity bonus to AC. In\nfact, his Dexterity score is treated as if it were 0 and his Dexterity\nmodifier to AC as if it were &#8211;5 (and a rogue can sneak attack him).</p>\n    <a id=\"coup-de-grace\"></a><p><b>Coup de Grace</b>: As a full-round action, you can use a\nmelee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless opponent. You can\nalso use a bow or crossbow, provided you are adjacent to the target.\nYou automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender\nsurvives the damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage\ndealt) or die. A rogue also gets her extra sneak attack damage against\na helpless opponent when delivering a coup de grace.</p>\n    <p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity\nfrom threatening opponents.</p>\n    <p>You can&#8217;t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is\nimmune to critical hits. You can deliver a coup de grace against a\ncreature with total concealment, but doing this requires two\nconsecutive full-round actions (one to &#8220;find&#8221; the creature once you&#8217;ve\ndetermined what square it&#8217;s in, and one to deliver the coup de grace).</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
