Her high Intelligence score might allow her to prepare a few\nextra spells. She can prepare the same spell more than once, but\neach preparation counts as one spell toward her daily limit. To\nprepare a spell the wizard must have an Intelligence score of at\nleast 10 + the spell&#8217;s level.\n    </p><a id=\"rest\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Rest</b>: To prepare her daily spells, a wizard must first\nsleep for 8 hours. The wizard does not have to slumber for every\nminute of the time, but she must refrain from movement, combat,\nspellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other fairly\ndemanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If her\nrest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total\namount of time she has to rest in order to clear her mind, and she\nmust have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior\nto preparing her spells. If the character does not need to sleep\nfor some reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful calm\nbefore preparing any spells.\n    </p><a id=\"recent-casting-limit-rest-interruptions\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Recent Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions</b>: If a wizard has\ncast spells recently, the drain on her resources reduces her\ncapacity to prepare new spells. When she prepares spells for the\ncoming day, all the spells she has cast within the last 8 hours\ncount against her daily limit.\n    </p><a id=\"preparation-environment\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Preparation Environment</b>: To prepare any spell, a wizard\nmust have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper\nconcentration. The wizard&#8217;s surroundings need not be luxurious,\nbut they must be free from overt distractions. Exposure to\ninclement weather prevents the necessary concentration, as does\nany injury or failed saving throw the character might experience\nwhile studying. Wizards also must have access to their spellbooks\nto study from and sufficient light to read them by. There is one\nmajor exception: A wizard can prepare a read magic spell even\nwithout a spellbook.\n    </p><a id=\"spell-preparation-time\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Spell Preparation Time</b>: After resting, a wizard must study\nher spellbook to prepare any spells that day. If she wants to\nprepare all her spells, the process takes 1 hour. Preparing some\nsmaller portion of her daily capacity takes a proportionally\nsmaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the\nminimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.\n    </p><a id=\"spell-selection-and-preparation\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Spell Selection and Preparation</b>: Until she prepares spells\nfrom her spellbook, the only spells a wizard has available to cast\nare the ones that she already had prepared from the previous day\nand has not yet used. During the study period, she chooses which\nspells to prepare. If a wizard already has spells prepared (from\nthe previous day) that she has not cast, she can abandon some or\nall of them to make room for new spells.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nWhen preparing spells for the day, a wizard can leave some of\nthese spell slots open. Later during that day, she can repeat the\npreparation process as often as she likes, time and circumstances\npermitting. During these extra sessions of preparation, the wizard\ncan fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon a\npreviously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a\nslot that is empty because she has cast a spell in the meantime.\nThat sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the\nfirst session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15\nminutes, and it takes longer if the wizard prepares more than\none-quarter of her spells.\n    </p><a id=\"spell-slots\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Spell Slots</b>: The various character class tables show how\nmany spells of each level a character can cast per day. These\nopenings for daily spells are called spell slots. A spellcaster\nalways has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot with a\nlower-level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability\nscore to cast spells that would otherwise be his or her due still\ngets the slots but must fill them with spells of lower level.\n    </p><a id=\"prepared-spell-retention\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Prepared Spell Retention</b>: Once a wizard prepares a spell,\nit remains in her mind as a nearly cast spell until she uses the\nprescribed components to complete and trigger it or until she\nabandons it. Certain other events, such as the effects of magic\nitems or special attacks from monsters, can wipe a prepared spell\nfrom a character�s mind.\n    </p><a id=\"death-and-prepared-spell-retention\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Death and Prepared Spell Retention</b>: If a spellcaster dies,\nall prepared spells stored in his or her mind are wiped away.\nPotent magic (such as raise dead, resurrection, or true\nresurrection) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the\ncharacter.\n    </p><a id=\"arcane-magical-writings\"></a>\n    <h5>\nARCANE MAGICAL WRITINGS\n    </h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">\n      <p>{`To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses\ncomplex notation that describes the magical forces involved in the\nspell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native\nlanguage or culture. However, each character uses the system in\nher own way. Another person`}{`’`}{`s magical writing remains\nincomprehensible to even the most powerful wizard until she takes\ntime to study and decipher it.`}</p>\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTo decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in\nwritten form in another&#8217;s spellbook or on a scroll), a character\nmust make a <a href=\"skillsAll.html#Spellcraft\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Spellcraft</a> check (DC 20 + the\nspell&#8217;s level). If the skill check fails, the character cannot\nattempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A\nread magic spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without\na skill check. If the person who created the magical writing is on\nhand to help the reader, success is also automatic.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nOnce a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does\nnot need to decipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing\nallows the reader to identify the spell and gives some idea of its\neffects (as explained in the spell description). If the magical\nwriting was a scroll and the reader can cast arcane spells, she\ncan attempt to use the scroll.\n    </p><a id=\"wizard-spells-and-borrowed-spellbooks\"></a>\n    <h6>\n      <p>{`Wizard Spells and Borrowed Spellbooks`}</p>\n    </h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">\nA wizard can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she\nalready knows and has recorded in her own spellbook, but\npreparation success is not assured. First, the wizard must\ndecipher the writing in the book (see Arcane Magical Writings,\nabove). Once a spell from another spellcaster&#8217;s book is\ndeciphered, the reader must make a <a href=\"\nSkillsAll.html#Spellcraft\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Spellcraft</a> check (DC 15 + spell&#8217;s\nlevel) to prepare the spell. If the check succeeds, the wizard can\nprepare the spell. She must repeat the check to prepare the spell\nagain, no matter how many times she has prepared it before. If the\ncheck fails, she cannot try to prepare the spell from the same\nsource again until the next day. (However, as explained above, she\ndoes not need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.)\n    </p><a id=\"adding-spells-to-a-wizards-spellbook\"></a>\n    <h6>\nAdding Spells to a Wizard&#8217;s Spellbook\n    </h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">\n      <p>{`Wizards can add new spells to their spellbooks through several\nmethods.

Each time a character\nattains a new wizard level, she gains two spells of her choice to\nadd to her spellbook. The two free spells must be of spell levels\nshe can cast. If she has chosen to specialize in a school of\nmagic, one of the two free spells must be from her specialty\nschool.\n    </p><a id=\"spells-copied-from-anothers-spellbook-or-scroll\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Spells Copied from Another&#8217;s Spellbook or a Scroll</b>: A\nwizard can also add a spell to her book whenever she encounters\none on a magic scroll or in another wizard&#8217;s spellbook. No matter\nwhat the spell&#8217;s source, the wizard must first decipher the\nmagical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Next, she\nmust spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she\nmust make a <a href=\"skillsAll.html#Spellcraft\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Spellcraft</a> check (DC 15 + spell&#8217;s\nlevel). A wizard who has specialized in a school of spells gains a\n+2 bonus on the Spellcraft check if the new spell is from her\nspecialty school. She cannot, however, learn any spells from her\nprohibited schools. If the check succeeds, the wizard understands\nthe spell and can copy it into her spellbook (see Writing a New\nSpell into a Spellbook, below). The process leaves a spellbook\nthat was copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied\nfrom a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf the check fails, the wizard cannot understand or copy the\nspell. She cannot attempt to learn or copy that spell again until\nshe gains another rank in Spellcraft. A spell that was being\ncopied from a scroll does not vanish from the scroll.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIn most cases, wizards charge a fee for the privilege of copying\nspells from their spellbooks. This fee is usually equal to the\nspell&#8217;s level x 50 gp.\n    </p><a id=\"independent-research\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Independent Research</b>: A wizard also can research a spell\nindependently, duplicating an existing spell or creating an\nentirely new one.\n    </p><a id=\"writing-a-new-spell-into-a-spellbook\"></a>\n    <h6>\n      <p>{`Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook`}</p>\n    </h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">\nOnce a wizard understands a new spell, she can record it into her\nspellbook.\n    </p><a id=\"writing-spell-time\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Time</b>: The process takes 24 hours, regardless of the spell&#8217;s\nlevel.\n    </p><a id=\"space-in-the-spellbook\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Space in the Spellbook</b>: A spell takes up one page of the\nspellbook per spell level.

A sorcerer&#8217;s or bard&#8217;s\nclass level limits the number of spells he can cast (see these\nclass descriptions). His high Charisma score might allow him to\ncast a few extra spells.

A\nsorcerer or bard needs 8 hours of rest (just like a wizard), after\nwhich he spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A bard must sing,\nrecite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.)\nDuring this period, the sorcerer or bard readies his mind to cast\nhis daily allotment of spells.
