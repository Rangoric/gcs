id=\"magic-overview\"></a><h2>Magic Overview</h2>\n    <p>A spell is a one-time magical effect. Spells come in two\ntypes: arcane (cast by bards, sorcerers, and wizards) and divine (cast\nby clerics, druids, and experienced paladins and rangers). Some\nspellcasters select their spells from a limited list of spells known,\nwhile others have access to a wide variety of options. Most\nspellcasters prepare their spells in advance&#8212;whether from a spellbook\nor through devout prayers and meditation&#8212; while some cast spells\nspontaneously without preparation. Despite these different ways that\ncharacters use to learn or prepare their spells, when it comes to\ncasting them, the spells are very much alike.</p>\n    <p>Cutting across the categories of arcane and divine spells are\nthe eight schools of magic. These schools represent the different ways\nthat spells take effect.</p>\n    <a id=\"casting-spells\"></a><h3>CASTING SPELLS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Whether a spell is arcane or divine, and\nwhether a character prepares spells in advance or chooses them on the\nspot, casting a spell works the same way.</p>\n    <a id=\"choosing-a-spell\"></a><h5>CHOOSING A SPELL</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">First you must choose which spell to cast. If\nyou&#8217;re a cleric, druid, experienced paladin, experienced ranger, or\nwizard, you select from among spells prepared earlier in the day and\nnot yet cast (see Preparing Wizard Spells and Preparing Divine Spells).\nIf you&#8217;re a bard or sorcerer, you can select any spell you know,\nprovided you are capable of casting spells of that level or higher.</p>\n    <p>To cast a spell, you must be able to speak (if the spell has a\nverbal component), gesture (if it has a somatic component), and\nmanipulate the material components or focus (if any). Additionally, you\nmust concentrate to cast a spell.</p>\n    <p>If a spell has multiple versions, you choose which version to\nuse when you cast it. You don&#8217;t have to prepare (or learn, in the case\nof a bard or sorcerer) a specific version of the spell.</p>\n    <p>Once you&#8217;ve cast a prepared spell, you can&#8217;t cast it again\nuntil you prepare it again. (If you&#8217;ve prepared multiple copies of a\nsingle spell, you can cast each copy once.) If you&#8217;re a bard or\nsorcerer, casting a spell counts against your daily limit for spells of\nthat spell level, but you can cast the same spell again if you haven&#8217;t\nreached your limit.</p>\n    <a id=\"concentration\"></a><h5>CONCENTRATION</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">To cast a spell, you must concentrate. If\nsomething interrupts your concentration while you&#8217;re casting, you must\nmake a <a href=\"skillsAll.html#concentration\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Concentration</a> check or lose the\nspell. The more distracting the\ninterruption and the higher the level of the spell you are trying to\ncast, the higher the DC is. If you fail the check, you lose the spell\njust as if you had cast it to no effect.</p>\n    <a id=\"injury\"></a><p><b>Injury</b>: If while trying to cast a spell you take\ndamage, you must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage\ntaken + the level of the spell you&#8217;re casting). If you fail the check,\nyou lose the spell without effect. The interrupting event strikes\nduring spellcasting if it comes between when you start and when you\ncomplete a spell (for a spell with a casting time of 1 full round or\nmore) or if it comes in response to your casting the spell (such as an\nattack of opportunity provoked by the spell or a contingent attack,\nsuch as a readied action).</p>\n    <p>If you are taking continuous damage half the damage is\nconsidered to take place while you are casting a spell. You must make a\nConcentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 the damage that the continuous source\nlast dealt + the level of the spell you&#8217;re casting). If the last damage\ndealt was the last damage that the effect could deal then the damage is\nover, and it does not distract you. Repeated damage does not count as\ncontinuous damage.</p>\n    <a id=\"spell\"></a><p><b>Spell</b>: If you are affected by a spell while attempting\nto cast a spell of your own, you must make a Concentration check or\nlose the spell you are casting. If the spell affecting you deals\ndamage, the DC is 10 + points of damage + the level of the spell you&#8217;re\ncasting.</p>\n    <p>If the spell interferes with you or distracts you in some\nother way, the DC is the spell&#8217;s saving throw DC + the level of the\nspell you&#8217;re casting. For a spell with no saving throw, it&#8217;s the DC\nthat the spell&#8217;s saving throw would have if a save were allowed.</p>\n    <a id=\"grappling-or-pinned\"></a><p><b>Grappling or Pinned</b>: The only spells you can cast while\n      <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#grappling\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>grappling</a> or <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#pinned\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>pinned</a> are those without somatic\ncomponents and whose\nmaterial components (if any) you have in hand. Even so, you must make a\nConcentration check (DC 20 + the level of the spell you&#8217;re casting) or\nlose the spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"vigorous-motion\"></a><p><b>Vigorous Motion</b>: If you are riding on a moving mount,\ntaking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rough water,\nbelow-decks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a\nsimilar fashion, you must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + the level\nof the spell you&#8217;re casting) or lose the spell. </p>\n    <a id=\"violent-motion\"></a><p><b>Violent Motion</b>: If you are on a galloping horse, taking\na very rough ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rapids or in a storm,\non deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a\nsimilar fashion, you must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level\nof the spell you&#8217;re casting) or lose the spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"violent-weather\"></a><p><b>Violent Weather</b>: You must make a Concentration check if\nyou try to cast a spell in violent weather. If you are in a high wind\ncarrying <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>blinding</a> rain or sleet, the DC\nis 5 + the level of the spell\nyou&#8217;re casting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC\nis 10 + the level of the spell you&#8217;re casting. In either case, you lose\nthe spell if you fail the Concentration check. If the weather is caused\nby a spell, use the rules in the Spell subsection above.</p>\n    <a id=\"casting-defensively\"></a><p><b>Casting Defensively</b>: If you want to cast a spell\nwithout provoking any attacks of opportunity, you must make a\nConcentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell you&#8217;re casting) to\nsucceed. You lose the spell if you fail.</p>\n    <a id=\"entangles\"></a><p><b>Entangled</b>: If you want to cast a spell while <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#entangled\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>entangled</a>\nin a net or by a tanglefoot bag or while you&#8217;re affected by a spell\nwith similar effects, you must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast\nthe spell. You lose the spell if you fail.</p>\n    <a id=\"counterspells\"></a><h5>COUNTERSPELLS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">It is possible to cast any spell as a\ncounterspell. By doing so, you are using the spell&#8217;s energy to disrupt\nthe casting of the same spell by another character. Counterspelling\nworks even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.</p>\n    <a id=\"how-counterspells-work\"></a><p><b>How Counterspells Work</b>: To use a counterspell, you must\nselect an opponent as the target of the counterspell. You do this by\nchoosing the ready action. In doing so, you elect to wait to complete\nyour action until your opponent tries to cast a spell. (You may still\nmove your speed, since ready is a standard action.)</p>\n    <p>If the target of your counterspell tries to cast a spell, make\na <a href=\"skillsAll.html#spellcraft\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Spellcraft</a>\ncheck (DC 15 + the spell&#8217;s level). This check is a free\naction. If the check succeeds, you correctly identify the opponent&#8217;s\nspell and can attempt to counter it. If the check fails, you can&#8217;t do\neither of these things.</p>\n    <p>To complete the action, you must then cast the correct spell.\nAs a general rule, a spell can only counter itself. If you are able to\ncast the same spell and you have it prepared (if you prepare spells),\nyou cast it, altering it slightly to create a counterspell effect. If\nthe target is within range, both spells automatically negate each other\nwith no other results.</p>\n    <a id=\"counterspelling-metamagic-spells\"></a><p><b>Counterspelling Metamagic Spells</b>: Metamagic feats are\nnot taken into account when determining whether a spell can be countered</p>\n    <a id=\"coiunterspelling-specific-exceptions\"></a><p><b>Specific Exceptions</b>: Some spells specifically counter\neach other, especially when they have diametrically opposed effects.</p>\n    <a id=\"dispel-as-a-counterspell\"></a><p><b>Dispel Magic as a Counterspell</b>: You can use dispel\nmagic to counterspell another spellcaster, and you don&#8217;t need to\nidentify the spell he or she is casting. However, dispel magic doesn&#8217;t\nalways work as a counterspell (see the spell description).</p>\n    <a id=\"caster-level\"></a><h5>CASTER LEVEL</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A spell&#8217;s power often depends on its caster\nlevel, which for most spellcasting characters is equal to your class\nlevel in the class you&#8217;re using to cast the spell. </p>\n    <p>You can cast a spell at a lower caster level than normal, but\nthe caster level you choose must be high enough for you to cast the\nspell in question, and all level-dependent features must be based on\nthe same caster level. </p>\n    <p>In the event that a class feature, domain granted power, or\nother special ability provides an adjustment to your caster level, that\nadjustment applies not only to effects based on caster level (such as\nrange, duration, and damage dealt) but also to your caster level check\nto overcome your target&#8217;s spell resistance and to the caster level used\nin dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check). </p>\n    <a id=\"spell-failure\"></a><h5>SPELL FAILURE</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">If you ever try to cast a spell in conditions\nwhere the characteristics of the spell cannot be made to conform, the\ncasting fails and the spell is wasted.</p>\n    <p>Spells also fail if your concentration is broken and might\nfail if you&#8217;re wearing armor while casting a spell with somatic\ncomponents.</p>\n    <a id=\"the-spells-results\"></a><h5>THE SPELL&#8217;S RESULT</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Once you know which creatures (or objects or\nareas) are affected, and whether those creatures have made successful\nsaving throws (if any were allowed), you can apply whatever results a\nspell entails.</p>\n    <a id=\"special-spell-effects\"></a><h5>SPECIAL SPELL EFFECTS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Many special spell effects are handled\naccording to the school of the spells in question Certain other special\nspell features are found across spell schools.</p>\n    <a id=\"attacks\"></a><p><b>Attacks</b>: Some spell descriptions refer to attacking.\nAll offensive combat actions, even those that don&#8217;t damage opponents\nare considered attacks. Attempts to turn or rebuke undead count as\nattacks. All spells that opponents resist with saving throws, that deal\ndamage, or that otherwise harm or hamper subjects are attacks. Spells\nthat summon monsters or other allies are not attacks because the spells\nthemselves don&#8217;t harm anyone.</p>\n    <a id=\"bonus-types\"></a><p><b>Bonus Types</b>: Usually, a bonus has a type that indicates\nhow the spell grants the bonus. The important aspect of bonus types is\nthat two bonuses of the same type don&#8217;t generally stack. With the\nexception of dodge bonuses, most circumstance bonuses, and racial\nbonuses, only the better bonus works (see Combining Magical Effects,\nbelow). The same principle applies to penalties&#8212;a character taking two\nor more penalties of the same type applies only the worst one.</p>\n    <a id=\"bringing-back-the-dead\"></a><p><b>Bringing Back the Dead</b>: Several spells have the power\nto restore slain characters to life.</p>\n    <p>When a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves\nthe Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide\non the plane where the creature&#8217;s deity resides. If the creature did\nnot worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its\nalignment. Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving his or\nher soul and returning it to his or her body.</p>\n    <a id=\"level-loss\"></a><p><i>Level Loss</i>: Any creature brought back to life usually\nloses one level of experience. The character&#8217;s new XP total is midway\nbetween the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) level and the\nminimum needed for the next one. If the character was 1st level at the\ntime of death, he or she loses 2 points of Constitution instead of\nlosing a level.</p>\n    <p>This level loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any\nmortal means, even wish or miracle. A revived character can regain a\nlost level by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived\ncharacter who was 1st level at the time of death can regain lost points\nof Constitution by improving his or her Constitution score when he or\nshe attains a level that allows an ability score increase.</p>\n    <a id=\"preventing-revivification\"></a><p><i>Preventing Revivification</i>: Enemies can take steps to\nmake it more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead.\nKeeping the body prevents others from using raise dead or resurrection\nto restore the slain character to life. Casting trap the soul prevents\nany sort of revivification unless the soul is first released.</p>\n    <a id=\"revivification-against-ones-will\"></a><p><i>Revivification against One&#8217;s Will</i>: A soul cannot be\nreturned to life if it does not wish to be. A soul knows the name,\nalignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to\nrevive it and may refuse to return on that basis.</p>\n    <a id=\"combining-magical-effects\"></a><h5>COMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Spells or magical effects usually work as\ndescribed, no matter how many other spells or magical effects happen to\nbe operating in the same area or on the same recipient. Except in\nspecial cases, a spell does not affect the way another spell operates.\nWhenever a spell has a specific effect on other spells, the spell\ndescription explains that effect. Several other general rules apply\nwhen spells or magical effects operate in the same place:</p>\n    <a id=\"stacking-effects\"></a><p><b>Stacking Effects</b>: Spells that provide bonuses or\npenalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and other\nattributes usually do not stack with themselves.</p>\n    <p>More generally, two bonuses of the same type don&#8217;t stack even\nif they come from different spells (or from effects other than spells;\nsee Bonus Types, above). </p>\n    <a id=\"different-bonus-names\"></a><p><i>Different Bonus Names</i>: The bonuses or penalties from\ntwo different spells stack if the modifiers are of different types.</p>\n    <p>A bonus that isn&#8217;t named stacks with any bonus.</p>\n    <a id=\"same-effect-more-than-once-in-different-strengths\"></a><p><i>Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths</i>: In\ncases when two or more identical spells are operating in the same area\nor on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one\napplies.</p>\n    <a id=\"same-effect-with-differing-results\"></a><p><i>Same Effect with Differing Results</i>: The same spell can\nsometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more\nthan once. Usually the last spell in the series trumps the others. None\nof the previous spells are actually removed or dispelled, but their\neffects become irrelevant while the final spell in the series lasts.</p>\n    <a id=\"one-effect-makes-another-irrelevant\"></a><p><i>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant</i>: Sometimes, one\nspell can render a later spell irrelevant. Both spells are still\nactive, but one has rendered the other useless in some fashion.</p>\n    <a id=\"multiple-mental-control-effects\"></a><p><i>Multiple Mental Control Effects</i>: Sometimes magical\neffects that establish mental control render each other irrelevant,\nsuch as a spell that removes the subjects ability to act. Mental\ncontrols that don&#8217;t remove the recipient&#8217;s ability to act usually do\nnot interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental\ncontrol of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of\nits ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If\nthe controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the\ncompeting controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine\nwhich one the creature obeys.</p>\n    <a id=\"spells-with-opposite-effects\"></a><p><b>Spells with Opposite Effects</b>: Spells with opposite\neffects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties, or changes\naccruing in the order that they apply. Some spells negate or counter\neach other. This is a special effect that is noted in a spell&#8217;s\ndescription. </p>\n    <a id=\"instantaneous-effects\"></a><p><b>Instantaneous Effects</b>: Two or more spells with\ninstantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect the same\ntarget.</p>\n    <a id=\"spell-descriptions\"></a><h3>SPELL DESCRIPTIONS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The description of each spell is presented in\na standard format. Each category of information is explained and\ndefined below.</p>\n    <a id=\"spell-name\"></a><h5>NAME</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The first line of every spell description\ngives the name by which the spell is generally known.</p>\n    <a id=\"school-subschool\"></a><h5>SCHOOL (SUBSCHOOL)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Beneath the spell name is a line giving the <a href=\"magicSchools.html\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>school of\nmagic</a> (and the subschool, if appropriate) that the spell belongs to.</p>\n    <a id=\"descriptor\"></a><h5>[DESCRIPTOR]</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Appearing on the same line as the school and\nsubschool, when applicable, is a descriptor that further categorizes\nthe spell in some way. Some spells have more than one descriptor.</p>\n    <p>The descriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, darkness, death,\nearth, electricity, evil, fear, fire, force, good, language-dependent,\nlawful, light, mind-affecting, sonic, and water.</p>\n    <p>Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves,\nbut they govern how the spell interacts with other spells, with special\nabilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so on.</p>\n    <p>A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a\nmedium for communication. If the target cannot understand or cannot\nhear what the caster of a language-dependant spell says the spell fails.</p>\n    <p>A mind-affecting spell works only against creatures with an\nIntelligence score of 1 or higher.</p>\n    <a id=\"level\"></a><h5>LEVEL</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The next line of a spell description gives the\nspell&#8217;s level, a number between 0 and 9 that defines the spell&#8217;s\nrelative power. This number is preceded by an abbreviation for the\nclass whose members can cast the spell. The Level entry also indicates\nwhether a spell is a domain spell and, if so, what its domain and its\nlevel as a domain spell are. A spell&#8217;s level affects the DC for any\nsave allowed against the effect.</p>\n    <p>Names of spellcasting classes are abbreviated as follows: bard\nBrd; cleric Clr; druid Drd; paladin Pal; ranger Rgr; sorcerer Sor;\nwizard Wiz.</p>\n    <p>The domains a spell can be associated with include Air,\nAnimal, Chaos, Death, Destruction, Earth, Evil, Fire, Good, Healing,\nKnowledge, Law, Luck, Magic, Plant, Protection, Strength, Sun, Travel,\nTrickery, War, and Water.</p>\n    <a id=\"components\"></a><h5>COMPONENTS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A spell&#8217;s components are what you must do or\npossess to cast it. The Components entry in a spell description\nincludes abbreviations that tell you what type of components it has.\nSpecifics for material, focus, and XP components are given at the end\nof the descriptive text. Usually you don&#8217;t worry about components, but\nwhen you can&#8217;t use a component for some reason or when a material or\nfocus component is expensive, then the components are important.</p>\n    <a id=\"verbal\"></a><p><b>Verbal (V)</b>: A verbal component is a spoken incantation.\nTo provide a verbal component, you must be able to speak in a strong\nvoice. A silence spell or a gag spoils the incantation (and thus the\nspell). A spellcaster who has been <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#deafened\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>deafened</a> has a 20% chance to\nspoil\nany spell with a verbal component that he or she tries to cast.</p>\n    <a id=\"somatic\"></a><p><b>Somatic (S)</b>: A somatic component is a measured and\nprecise movement of the hand. You must have at least one hand free to\nprovide a somatic component.</p>\n    <a id=\"material\"></a><p><b>Material (M)</b>: A material component is one or more\nphysical substances or objects that are annihilated by the spell\nenergies in the casting process. Unless a cost is given for a material\ncomponent, the cost is negligible. Don&#8217;t bother to keep track of\nmaterial components with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need\nas long as you have your spell component pouch.</p>\n    <a id=\"focus\"></a><p><b>Focus (F)</b>: A focus component is a prop of some sort.\nUnlike a material component, a focus is not consumed when the spell is\ncast and can be reused. As with material components, the cost for a\nfocus is negligible unless a price is given. Assume that focus\ncomponents of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch.</p>\n    <a id=\"divine-focus\"></a><p><b>Divine Focus (DF)</b>: A divine focus component is an item\nof spiritual significance. The divine focus for a cleric or a paladin\nis a holy symbol appropriate to the character&#8217;s faith. </p>\n    <p>If the Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane\nversion of the spell has a focus component or a material component (the\nabbreviation before the slash) and the divine version has a divine\nfocus component (the abbreviation after the slash).</p>\n    <a id=\"xp-cost\"></a><p><b>XP Cost (XP)</b>: Some powerful spells entail an experience\npoint cost to you. No spell can restore the XP lost in this manner. You\ncannot spend so much XP that you lose a level, so you cannot cast the\nspell unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining\nenough XP to attain a new level, use those XP for casting a spell\nrather than keeping them and advancing a level. The XP are treated just\nlike a material component&#8212;expended when you cast the spell, whether or\nnot the casting succeeds.</p>\n    <a id=\"casting-time\"></a><h5>CASTING TIME</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Most spells have a casting time of 1 standard\naction. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a free\naction.</p>\n    <p>A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It\ncomes into effect just before the beginning of your turn in the round\nafter you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the\nspell is completed.</p>\n    <p>A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just\nbefore your turn 1 minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you\nare casting a spell as a full-round action, just as noted above for 1-\nround casting times). These actions must be consecutive and\nuninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.</p>\n    <p>When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast,\nyou must continue the concentration from the current round to just\nbefore your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose\nconcentration before the casting is complete, you lose the spell.</p>\n    <p>A spell with a casting time of 1 free action doesn&#8217;t count\nagainst your normal limit of one spell per round. However, you may cast\nsuch a spell only once per round. Casting a spell with a casting time\nof 1 free action doesn&#8217;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <p>You make all pertinent decisions about a spell (range, target,\narea, effect, version, and so forth) when the spell comes into effect.</p>\n    <a id=\"range\"></a><h5>RANGE</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A spell&#8217;s range indicates how far from you it\ncan reach, as defined in the Range entry of the spell description. A\nspell&#8217;s range is the maximum distance from you that the spell&#8217;s effect\ncan occur, as well as the maximum distance at which you can designate\nthe spell&#8217;s point of origin. If any portion of the spell&#8217;s area would\nextend beyond this range, that area is wasted. Standard ranges include\nthe following.</p>\n    <a id=\"range-personal\"></a><p><b>Personal</b>: The spell affects only you.</p>\n    <a id=\"range-touch\"></a><p><b>Touch</b>: You must touch a creature or object to affect\nit. A touch spell that deals damage can score a critical hit just as a\nweapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of\n20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit. Some touch\nspells allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch as many\nwilling targets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all\ntargets of the spell must be touched in the same round that you finish\ncasting the spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"range-close\"></a><p><b>Close</b>: The spell reaches as far as 25 feet away from\nyou. The maximum range increases by 5 feet for every two full caster\nlevels.</p>\n    <a id=\"range-medium\"></a><p><b>Medium</b>: The spell reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet\nper caster level.</p>\n    <a id=\"range-long\"></a><p><b>Long</b>: The spell reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet\nper caster level.</p>\n    <a id=\"range-unlimited\"></a><p><b>Unlimited</b>: The spell reaches anywhere on the same plane\nof existence.</p>\n    <a id=\"range-expressed-in-feet\"></a><p><b>Range Expressed in Feet</b>: Some spells have no standard\nrange category, just a range expressed in feet.</p>\n    <a id=\"aiming-a-spell\"></a><h5>AIMING A SPELL</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">You must make some choice about whom the spell\nis to affect or where the effect is to originate, depending on the type\nof spell. The next entry in a spell description defines the spell&#8217;s\ntarget (or targets), its effect, or its area, as appropriate.</p>\n    <a id=\"target-or-targets\"></a><p><b>Target or Targets</b>: Some spells have a target or\ntargets. You cast these spells on creatures or objects, as defined by\nthe spell itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you\nmust specifically choose that target. You do not have to select your\ntarget until you finish casting the spell.</p>\n    <p>If the target of a spell is yourself (the spell description\nhas a line that reads Target: You), you do not receive a saving throw,\nand spell resistance does not apply. The Saving Throw and Spell\nResistance lines are omitted from such spells.</p>\n    <p>Some spells restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring\nyourself as a willing target is something that can be done at any time\n(even if you&#8217;re <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#flat-footed\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>flat-footed</a> or it isn&#8217;t your\nturn). <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Unconscious</a>\ncreatures are automatically considered willing, but a character who is\nconscious but immobile or <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#helpless\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>helpless</a> (such as one who is\nbound, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#cowering\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>cowering</a>, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#grappling\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>grappling</a>, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#paralyzed\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>paralyzed</a>, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#pinned\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>pinned</a>, or <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>stunned</a>) is not automatically\nwilling.</p>\n    <p>Some spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or\nareas after you cast the spell. Redirecting a spell is a move action\nthat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <a id=\"effect\"></a><p><b>Effect</b>: Some spells create or summon things rather than\naffecting things that are already present. You must designate the\nlocation where these things are to appear, either by seeing it or\ndefining it. Range determines how far away an effect can appear, but if\nthe effect is mobile it can move regardless of the spell&#8217;s range.</p>\n    <a id=\"ray\"></a><p><i>Ray</i>: Some effects are rays. You aim a ray as if using a\nranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged touch attack rather\nthan a normal ranged attack. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into\nthe dark or at an <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>invisible</a> creature and hope you\nhit something. You\ndon&#8217;t have to see the creature you&#8217;re trying to hit, as you do with a\ntargeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block\nyour line of sight or provide cover for the creature you&#8217;re aiming at.</p>\n    <p>If a ray spell has a duration, it&#8217;s the duration of the effect\nthat the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself persists.</p>\n    <p>If a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just\nas if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a\nnatural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.</p>\n    <a id=\"spread\"></a><p><i>Spread</i>: Some effects, notably clouds and fogs, spread\nout from a point of origin, which must be a grid intersection. The\neffect can extend around corners and into areas that you can&#8217;t see.\nFigure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns\nthe spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread effects,\ncount around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace\ndiagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for\nsuch an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all\nportions of the effect.</p>\n    <a id=\"area\"></a><p><b>Area</b>: Some spells affect an area. Sometimes a spell\ndescription specifies a specially defined area, but usually an area\nfalls into one of the categories defined below.</p>\n    <p>Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point\nwhere the spell originates, but otherwise you don&#8217;t control which\ncreatures or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell\nis always a grid intersection. When determining whether a given\ncreature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance from the\npoint of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or\nwhen determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is\nthat instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of\nthe next, you count from intersection to intersection. You can count\ndiagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal\ncounts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within\nthe spell&#8217;s area, anything within that square is within the spell&#8217;s\narea. If the spell&#8217;s area only touches the near edge of a square,\nhowever, anything within that square is unaffected by the spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"burst-emanation-or-spread\"></a><p><i>Burst, Emanation, or Spread</i>: Most spells that affect an\narea function as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you\nselect the spell&#8217;s point of origin and measure its effect from that\npoint.</p>\n    <p>A burst spell affects whatever it catches in its area, even\nincluding creatures that you can&#8217;t see. It can&#8217;t affect creatures with\ntotal cover from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don&#8217;t\nextend around corners). The default shape for a burst effect is a\nsphere, but some burst spells are specifically described as\ncone-shaped. A burst&#8217;s area defines how far from the point of origin\nthe spell&#8217;s effect extends.</p>\n    <p>An emanation spell functions like a burst spell, except that\nthe effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the\nduration of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.</p>\n    <p>A spread spell spreads out like a burst but can turn corners.\nYou select the point of origin, and the spell spreads out a given\ndistance in all directions. Figure the area the spell effect fills by\ntaking into account any turns the spell effect takes.</p>\n    <a id=\"cone-cylinder-line-or-sphere\"></a><p><i>Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere</i>: Most spells that\naffect an area have a particular shape, such as a cone, cylinder, line,\nor sphere.</p>\n    <p>A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle\nin the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your\nsquare and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or\nemanations (see above), and thus won&#8217;t go around corners.</p>\n    <p>When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell&#8217;s\npoint of origin. This point is the center of a horizontal circle, and\nthe spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A\ncylinder-shaped spell ignores any obstructions within its area.</p>\n    <p>A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the\ndirection you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and\nextends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that\nblocks line of effect. A line-shaped spell affects all creatures in\nsquares that the line passes through.</p>\n    <p>A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill\na spherical area. Spheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p>\n    <a id=\"creatures\"></a><p><i>Creatures</i>: A spell with this kind of area affects\ncreatures directly (like a targeted spell), but it affects all\ncreatures in an area of some kind rather than individual creatures you\nselect. The area might be a spherical burst , a cone-shaped burst, or\nsome other shape.</p>\n    <p>Many spells affect &#8220;living creatures,&#8221; which means all\ncreatures other than constructs and undead. Creatures in the spell&#8217;s\narea that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the\ncreatures affected.</p>\n    <a id=\"objects\"></a><p><i>Objects</i>: A spell with this kind of area affects objects\nwithin an area you select (as Creatures, but affecting objects instead).</p>\n    <a id=\"other\"></a><p><i>Other</i>: A spell can have a unique area, as defined in\nits description.</p>\n    <a id=\"shapeable\"></a><p><i>(S) Shapeable</i>: If an Area or Effect entry ends with\n&#8220;(S),&#8221; you can shape the spell. A shaped effect or area can have no\ndimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or areas are given as\ncubes to make it easy to model irregular shapes. Three-dimensional\nvolumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater effects\nand areas.</p>\n    <a id=\"line-of-effect\"></a><p><b>Line of Effect</b>: A line of effect is a straight,\nunblocked path that indicates what a spell can affect. A line of effect\nis canceled by a solid barrier. It&#8217;s like line of sight for ranged\nweapons, except that it&#8217;s not blocked by fog, darkness, and other\nfactors that limit normal sight.</p>\n    <p>You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you\ncast a spell on or to any space in which you wish to create an effect.\nYou must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any\nspell you cast. A burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects\nonly an area, creatures, or objects to which it has line of effect from\nits origin (a spherical burst&#8217;s center point, a cone-shaped burst&#8217;s\nstarting point, a cylinder&#8217;s circle, or an emanation&#8217;s point of origin).</p>\n    <p>An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square\nfoot through it does not block a spell&#8217;s line of effect. Such an\nopening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no\nlonger considered a barrier for purposes of a spell&#8217;s line of effect.</p>\n    <a id=\"duration\"></a><h5>DURATION</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A spell&#8217;s Duration entry tells you how long\nthe magical energy of the spell lasts.</p>\n    <a id=\"timed-durations\"></a><p><b>Timed Durations</b>: Many durations are measured in rounds,\nminutes, hours, or some other increment. When the time is up, the magic\ngoes away and the spell ends. If a spell&#8217;s duration is variable the\nduration is rolled secretly (the caster doesn&#8217;t know how long the spell\nwill last). </p>\n    <a id=\"instantaneous\"></a><p><b>Instantaneous</b>: The spell energy comes and goes the\ninstant the spell is cast, though the consequences might be\nlong-lasting.</p>\n    <a id=\"permanent\"></a><p><b>Permanent</b>: The energy remains as long as the effect\ndoes. This means the spell is vulnerable to dispel magic. </p>\n    <a id=\"duration-concentration\"></a><p><b>Concentration</b>: The spell lasts as long as you\nconcentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard\naction that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Anything that\ncould break your concentration when casting a spell can also break your\nconcentration while you&#8217;re maintaining one, causing the spell to end.\nYou can&#8217;t cast a spell while concentrating on another one. Sometimes a\nspell lasts for a short time after you cease concentrating.</p>\n    <a id=\"subjects-effects-and-areas\"></a><p><b>Subjects, Effects, and Areas</b>: If the spell affects\ncreatures directly the result travels with the subjects for the spell&#8217;s\nduration. If the spell creates an effect, the effect lasts for the\nduration. The effect might move or remain still. Such an effect can be\ndestroyed prior to when its duration ends. If the spell affects an area\nthen the spell stays with that area for its duration. Creatures become\nsubject to the spell when they enter the area and are no longer subject\nto it when they leave.</p>\n    <a id=\"touch-spells-and-holding-the-charge\"></a><p><b>Touch Spells and Holding the Charge</b>: In most cases, if\nyou don&#8217;t discharge a touch spell on the round you cast it, you can\nhold the charge (postpone the discharge of the spell) indefinitely. You\ncan make touch attacks round after round. If you cast another spell,\nthe touch spell dissipates.</p>\n    <p>Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets as part\nof the spell. You can&#8217;t hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch\nall targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the\nspell.</p>\n    <a id=\"discharge\"></a><p><b>Discharge</b>: Occasionally a spells lasts for a set\nduration or until triggered or discharged.</p>\n    <a id=\"dismissible\"></a><p><b>(D) Dismissible</b>: If the Duration line ends with &#8220;(D),&#8221;\nyou can dismiss the spell at will. You must be within range of the\nspell&#8217;s effect and must speak words of dismissal, which are usually a\nmodified form of the spell&#8217;s verbal component. If the spell has no\nverbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a gesture. Dismissing\na spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of\nopportunity. A spell that depends on concentration is dismissible by\nits very nature, and dismissing it does not take an action, since all\nyou have to do to end the spell is to stop concentrating on your turn.</p>\n    <a id=\"saving-throw\"></a><h5>SAVING THROW</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Usually a harmful spell allows a target to\nmake a saving throw to avoid some or all of the effect. The Saving\nThrow entry in a spell description defines which type of saving throw\nthe spell allows and describes how saving throws against the spell work.</p>\n    <a id=\"negates\"></a><p><b>Negates</b>: The spell has no effect on a subject that\nmakes a successful saving throw.</p>\n    <a id=\"partial\"></a><p><b>Partial</b>: The spell causes an effect on its subject. A\nsuccessful saving throw means that some lesser effect occurs.</p>\n    <a id=\"half\"></a><p><b>Half</b>: The spell deals damage, and a successful saving\nthrow halves the damage taken (round down).</p>\n    <a id=\"none\"></a><p><b>None</b>: No saving throw is allowed.</p>\n    <a id=\"disbelief\"></a><p><b>Disbelief</b>: A successful save lets the subject ignore\nthe effect. </p>\n    <a id=\"object\"></a><p><b>(object)</b>: The spell can be cast on objects, which\nreceive saving throws only if they are magical or if they are attended\n(held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell,\nin which case the object uses the creature&#8217;s saving throw bonus unless\nits own bonus is greater. (This notation does not mean that a spell can\nbe cast only on objects. Some spells of this sort can be cast on\ncreatures or objects.) A magic item&#8217;s saving throw bonuses are each\nequal to 2 + one-half the item&#8217;s caster level. </p>\n    <a id=\"harmless\"></a><p><b>(harmless)</b>: The spell is usually beneficial, not\nharmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving throw if it\ndesires.</p>\n    <a id=\"saving-throw-difficulty-class\"></a><p><b>Saving Throw Difficulty Class</b>: A saving throw against\nyour spell has a DC of 10 + the level of the spell + your bonus for the\nrelevant ability (Intelligence for a wizard, Charisma for a sorcerer or\nbard, or Wisdom for a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger). A spell&#8217;s\nlevel can vary depending on your class. Always use the spell level\napplicable to your class.</p>\n    <a id=\"succeeding-on-a-saving-throw\"></a><p><b>Succeeding on a Saving Throw</b>: A creature that\nsuccessfully saves against a spell that has no obvious physical effects\nfeels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature\nof the attack. Likewise, if a creature&#8217;s saving throw succeeds against\na targeted spell you sense that the spell has failed. You do not sense\nwhen creatures succeed on saves against effect and area spells.</p>\n    <a id=\"automatic-failures-and-successes\"></a><p><b>Automatic Failures and Successes</b>: A natural 1 (the d20\ncomes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure, and the spell may\ncause damage to exposed items (see Items Surviving after a Saving\nThrow, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</p>\n    <a id=\"voluntarily-giving-up-a-saving-throw\"></a><p><b>Voluntarily Giving up a Saving Throw</b>: A creature can\nvoluntarily forego a saving throw and willingly accept a spell&#8217;s\nresult. Even a character with a special resistance to magic can\nsuppress this quality.</p>\n    <a id=\"items-surviving-after-a-saving-throw\"></a><p><b>Items Surviving after a Saving Throw</b>: Unless the\ndescriptive text for the spell specifies otherwise, all items carried\nor worn by a creature are assumed to survive a magical attack. If a\ncreature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw against the effect,\nhowever, an exposed item is harmed (if the attack can harm objects).\nRefer to Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Determine which four\nobjects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected\nand roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a\nsaving throw against the attack form and take whatever damage the\nattack deal.</p>\n    <p>If an item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does\nnot get a saving throw. It simply is dealt the appropriate damage.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-items-affected-by-magical-attacks\"></a><p><b>Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks</b></p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr valign=\"bottom\">\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"75px\"\n          }}>Order<sup>1</sup></th>\n          <th>Item</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>1st</td>\n          <td>Shield</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>2nd</td>\n          <td>Armor</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>3rd</td>\n          <td>Magic helmet, hat, or headband</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>4th</td>\n          <td>Item in hand (including weapon, wand, or the like)</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>5th</td>\n          <td>Magic cloak</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>6th</td>\n          <td>Stowed or sheathed weapon</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>7th</td>\n          <td>Magic bracers</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>8th</td>\n          <td>Magic clothing</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>9th</td>\n          <td>Magic jewelry (including rings)</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">10th</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Anything else</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"2\">1 <i>In order of most likely to least\nlikely to be affected.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <a id=\"spell-resistance\"></a><h5>SPELL RESISTANCE</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Spell resistance is a special defensive\nability. If your spell is being resisted by a creature with spell\nresistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) at\nleast equal to the creature&#8217;s spell resistance for the spell to affect\nthat creature. The defender&#8217;s spell resistance is like an Armor Class\nagainst magical attacks. Include any adjustments to your caster level\nto this caster level check.</p>\n    <p>The Spell Resistance entry and the descriptive text of a spell\ndescription tell you whether spell resistance protects creatures from\nthe spell. In many cases, spell resistance applies only when a\nresistant creature is targeted by the spell, not when a resistant\ncreature encounters a spell that is already in place.</p>\n    <p>The terms &#8220;object&#8221; and &#8220;harmless&#8221; mean the same thing for\nspell resistance as they do for saving throws. A creature with spell\nresistance must voluntarily lower the resistance (a standard action) in\norder to be affected by a spell noted as harmless. In such a case, you\ndo not need to make the caster level check described above.</p>\n    <a id=\"decriptive\"></a><h5>DESCRIPTIVE TEXT</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This portion of a spell description details\nwhat the spell does and how it works. If one of the previous entries in\nthe description included &#8220;see text,&#8221; this is where the explanation is\nfound. </p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
