The attacking creature can only\npush\nthe opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&rsquo;t move\ncloser to\nthe attacking creature than the square it started in. If an obstacle\nprevents the completion of the opponent&rsquo;s move, the opponent and\nthe\nobstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the\nspace adjacent to the obstacle.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"craft-construct\"></a>CRAFT CONSTRUCT [ITEM CREATION]</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Craft Magic Arms and\nArmor, Craft Wondrous Item.</p>\n    <p><b>Benefit</b>: A creature with this feat can create any\nconstruct whose prerequisites it meets. Enchanting a construct takes\none day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To enchant a construct,\na spellcaster must spend 1/25 the item&rsquo;s price in XP and use up\nraw\nmaterials costing half of this price (see individual construct monster\nentries for details).</p>\n    <p>A creature with this feat can repair constructs that have\ntaken damage.

Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like\nabilities without random variables are not affected.</p>\n    <p>The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating\na spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round\ndown) &ndash;2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the\nQuicken Spell-Like Ability feat. </p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: This feat can be taken multiple times.

The creature cannot take a second move action during a\nround when it makes a flyby attack.</p>\n    <p><b>Normal</b>: Without this feat, the creature takes a\nstandard action either before or after its move.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"hover\"></a>HOVER [GENERAL]</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Fly speed.</p>\n    <p><b>Benefit</b>: When flying, the creature can halt its forward\nmotion and hover in place as a move action. It can then fly in any\ndirection, including straight down or straight up, at half speed,\nregardless of its maneuverability.</p>\n    <p>If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in place\nfor the turn and take a full-round action. A hovering creature cannot\nmake wing attacks, but it can attack with all other limbs and\nappendages it could use in a full attack. The creature can instead use\na breath weapon or cast a spell instead of making physical attacks, if\nit could normally do so.</p>\n    <p>If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet of\nthe ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its\nwings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds\nso generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and\nother small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the\ncloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 to 20\nfeet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total\nconcealment (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate\nthe creature).</p>\n    <p>Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a <a href=\"skillsAll.html#concentration\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Concentration</a>\ncheck (DC 10 + 1/2 creature&rsquo;s HD) to cast a spell.</p>\n    <p><b>Normal</b>: Without this feat, a creature must keep moving\nwhile flying unless it has perfect maneuverability.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"improved-natural-armor\"></a>IMPROVED NATURAL ARMOR\n[GENERAL]</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Natural armor, Con 13.</p>\n    <p><b>Benefit</b>: The creature&rsquo;s natural armor bonus\nincreases\nby 1.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: A creature can gain this feat multiple times.\nEach time the creature takes the feat its natural armor bonus increases\nby another point.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"improved-natural-attack\"></a>IMPROVED NATURAL ATTACK\n[GENERAL]</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Natural weapon, base\nattack bonus +4.</p>\n    <p><b>Benefit</b>: Choose one of the creature&rsquo;s natural\nattack\nforms.

(It has one primary hand, and all the others are\noff hands.) See Two-Weapon Fighting.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Fighting\nfeat for creatures with more than two arms.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"quicken-spell-like-ability\"></a>QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE\nABILITY [GENERAL]</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Spell-like ability at\ncaster level 10th or higher.</p>\n    <p><b>Benefit</b>: Choose one of the creature&rsquo;s spell-like\nabilities, subject to the restrictions described below. The creature\ncan use that ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per\nday (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per\nday).</p>\nUsing a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not\nprovoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another\naction&mdash;including the use of another spell-like ability&mdash;in\nthe same\nround that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use\nonly one quickened spell-like ability per round.\n    <p>The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating\na spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round\ndown) &ndash;4. For a summary, see the table below.</p>\n    <p>In addition, a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with\na casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.</p>\n    <p><b>Normal</b>: Normally the use of a spell-like ability\nrequires a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless\nnoted otherwise.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: This feat can be taken multiple times.
