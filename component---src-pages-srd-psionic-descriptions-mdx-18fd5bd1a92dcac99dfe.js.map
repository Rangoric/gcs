A power might be known by other names in some\nlocales, and specific manifesters might have names of their own for\ntheir powers.\n    <a id=\"discipline-subdiscipline\"></a><h5>DISCIPLINE (SUBDISCIPLINE)</h5>\nBeneath the power name is a line giving the discipline (and the\nsubdiscipline in parentheses, if appropriate) that the power belongs to.\n    <p>{`Every power is associated with one of six disciplines. A discipline is\na group of related powers that work in similar ways. Each of the\ndisciplines is discussed below.`}</p>\n    <a id=\"clairsentience\"></a><h6>Clairsentience</h6>\nClairsentience powers enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to\nglimpse the immediate future and predict the far future, to find hidden\nobjects, and to know what is normally unknowable.\n    <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency, clairsentience\npowers are equivalent to powers of the divination school (thus,\ncreatures immune to divination spells are also immune to clairsentience\npowers).</p>\n    <p>Many clairsentience powers have cone-shaped areas. These move\nwith you and extend in the direction you look. The cone defines the\narea that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for\nmultiple rounds, you can often gain additional information, as noted in\nthe descriptive text for the power.</p>\n    <a id=\"scrying\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Scrying:</span> A power of\nthe scrying subdiscipline creates an invisible sensor that sends you\ninformation. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of\nsensory acuity that you possess. This includes any powers or effects\nthat target you, but not powers or effects that emanate from you.\nHowever, the sensor is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ\nof yours, and thus functions normally even if you have been <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>blinded</a>, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#deafened\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>deafened</a>, or otherwise suffered\nsensory impairment. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or\nhigher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence check. The\nsensor can be <a href=\"psionicPowersDtoF.html#dispel-psionics\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>dispelled</a> as if it were an\nactive power. Lead sheeting or psionic protection blocks scrying\npowers, and you sense that the power is so blocked.</p>\n    <a id=\"metacreativity\"></a><h6>Metacreativity</h6>\nMetacreativity powers create objects, creatures, or some form of\nmatter. Creatures you create usually, but not always, obey your\ncommands.\n    <p>{`A metacreativity power draws raw ectoplasm from the Astral Plane to\ncreate an object or creature in the place the psionic character\ndesignates (subject to the limits noted above). Objects created in this\nfashion are as solid and durable as normal objects, despite their\noriginally diaphanous substance. Psionic creatures created with\nmetacreativity powers are considered constructs, not outsiders.`}</p>\n    <p>A creature or object brought into being cannot appear inside\nanother creature or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty\nspace. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of\nsupporting it. The creature or object must appear within the\npower&rsquo;s\nrange, but it does not have to remain within the range.</p>\n    <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency, metacreativity\npowers are equivalent to powers of the conjuration school (thus,\ncreatures immune to conjuration spells are also immune to\nmetacreativity powers).</p>\n    <a id=\"creation\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Creation:</span> A power of\nthe creation subdiscipline creates an object or creature in the place\nthe manifester designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the\npower has a duration other than instantaneous, psionic energy holds the\ncreation together, and when the power ends, the created creature or\nobject vanishes without a trace, except for a thin film of glistening\nectoplasm that quickly evaporates. If the power has an instantaneous\nduration, the created object or creature is merely assembled through\npsionics. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on psionics for its\nexistence.</p>\n    <a id=\"psychokinesis\"></a><h6>Psychokinesis</h6>\nPsychokinesis powers manipulate energy or tap the power of the mind to\nproduce a desired end. Many of these powers produce spectacular effects\nabove and beyond the power&rsquo;s standard display (see <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n    }} href=\"#display\">Display</a>,\nbelow), such as moving, melting, transforming, or blasting a target.\nPsychokinesis powers can deal large amounts of damage.\n    <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency, psychokinesis\npowers are equivalent to powers of the evocation school (thus,\ncreatures immune to evocation spells are also immune to psychokinesis\npowers).</p>\n    <a id=\"psychometabolism\"></a><h6>Psychometabolism</h6>\nPsychometabolism powers change the physical properties of some\ncreature, thing, or condition. \n    <p>For the purpose of psionics- magic transparency,\npsychometabolism powers are equivalent to powers of the transmutation\nschool (thus, creatures immune to transmutation spells are also immune\nto psychometabolism powers).</p>\n    <a id=\"healing\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Healing:</span>\nPsychometabolism powers of the healing subdiscipline can remove damage\nfrom creatures. However, psionic healing usually falls short of divine\nmagical healing, in direct comparisons. </p>\n    <a id=\"psychoportation\"></a><h6>Psychoportation</h6>\nPsychoportation powers move the manifester, an object, or another\ncreature through space and time.\n    <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency,\npsychoportation powers do not have an equivalent school.</p>\n    <a id=\"teleportation\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Teleportation:</span> A power\nof the teleportation subdiscipline transports one or more creatures or\nobjects a great distance. The most potent of these powers can cross\nplanar boundaries. Usually the transportation is one-way (unless\notherwise noted) and not dispellable. Teleportation is instantaneous\ntravel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel\nalso blocks teleportation.</p>\n    <a id=\"telepathy\"></a><h6>Telepathy</h6>\nTelepathy powers can spy on and affect the minds of others, influencing\nor controlling their behavior.\n    <p>Most telepathy powers are mind-affecting.</p>\n    <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency, telepathy\npowers are equivalent to powers of the enchantment school (thus,\ncreatures resistant to enchantment spells are equally resistant to\ntelepathy powers).</p>\n    <a id=\"charm\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Charm:</span> A power of the\ncharm subdiscipline changes the way the subject views you, typically\nmaking it see you as a good friend.</p>\n    <a id=\"compulsion\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Compulsion:</span> A power of\nthe compulsion subdiscipline forces the subject to act in some manner\nor changes the way her mind works. Some compulsion powers determine the\nsubject&rsquo;s actions or the effects on the subject, some allow you\nto\ndetermine the subject&rsquo;s actions when you manifest them, and\nothers give\nyou ongoing control over the subject.</p>\n    <a id=\"descriptor\"></a><h5>[DESCRIPTOR]</h5>\nAppearing on the same line as the discipline and subdiscipline (when\napplicable) is a descriptor that further categorizes the power in some\nway. Some powers have more than one descriptor.\n    <p>The descriptors that apply to powers are acid, cold, death,\nelectricity, evil, fire, force, good, language-dependent, light,\nmind-affecting, and sonic.</p>\n    <p>Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves,\nbut they govern how the power interacts with other powers, with spells,\nwith special abilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so\non.</p>\n    <p>A language-dependent power uses intelligible language as a\nmedium. </p>\n    <p>A mind-affecting power works only against creatures with an\nIntelligence score of 1 or higher.</p>\n    <a id=\"level\"></a><h5>LEVEL</h5>\nThe next line of the power description gives a power&rsquo;s level, a\nnumber\nbetween 1 and 9 that defines the power&rsquo;s relative strength. This\nnumber\nis preceded by the name of the class whose members can manifest the\npower. If a power is part of a discipline&rsquo;s list instead of the\npsion&rsquo;s\ngeneral power list, this will be indicated by the name of the\ndiscipline&rsquo;s specialist. The specialists a power can be\nassociated with\ninclude Egoist (psychometabolism), Kineticist (psychokinesis), Nomad\n(psychoportation), Seer (clairsentience), Shaper (metacreativity), and\nTelepath (telepathy). \n    <h5><a id=\"display\"></a>DISPLAY</h5>\nWhen a power is manifested, a display may accompany the primary effect.\nThis secondary effect may be auditory, material, mental, olfactory, or\nvisual. No power&rsquo;s display is significant enough to create\nconsequences\nfor the psionic creatures, allies, or opponents during combat. The\nsecondary effect for a power occurs only if the power&rsquo;s\ndescription\nindicates it. If multiple powers with similar displays are in effect\nsimultaneously, the displays do not necessary become more intense.\nInstead, the overall display remains much the same, though with minute\nspikes in intensity. A <a href=\"psionicSkills.html#psicraft\" style={{\n      \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n    }}>Psicraft</a> check (DC 10 + 1 per\nadditional power in use) reveals the exact number of simultaneous\npowers in play.\n    <a id=\"dispense-with-displays\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Dispense with Displays:</span>\nDespite the fact that almost every power has a display, a psionic\ncharacter can always choose to manifest the power without the flashy\naccompaniment. To manifest a power without any display (no matter how\nmany displays it might have), a manifester must make a <a href=\"psionicSkills.html#concentration\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + the\nlevel of the power). This check is part of the action of manifesting\nthe power. If the check is unsuccessful, the power manifests normally\nwith its display.</p>\n    <p>Even if a manifester manifests a power without a display, he\nis still subject to attacks of opportunity in appropriate\ncircumstances.

Others take 1\nround or more, while a few require only a free action.\n    <p>A power that takes 1 round to manifest requires a full-round\naction. It comes into effect just before the beginning of your turn in\nthe round after you began manifesting the power. You then act normally\nafter the power is completed. </p>\n    <p>A power that takes 1 minute to manifest comes into effect just\nbefore your turn 1 minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you\nare manifesting a power as a full-round action, as noted above for\n1-round manifesting times). These actions must be consecutive and\nuninterrupted, or the power points are lost and the power fails.</p>\n    <p>When you use a power that takes 1 round or longer to manifest,\nyou must continue the concentration from the current round to just\nbefore your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose\nconcentration before the manifesting time is complete, the power points\nare lost and the power fails.</p>\n    <p>You make all pertinent decisions about a power (range, target,\narea, effect, version, and so forth) when the power comes into effect. </p>\n    <a id=\"new-action-types\"></a><h6>New Action Types</h6>\n    <a id=\"swift-action\"></a><span style={{\n      \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n    }}>Swift Action:</span> A swift\naction consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger\nexpenditure of effort and energy than a free action. You can perform\none swift action per turn without affecting your ability to perform\nother actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action.\nHowever, you can perform only a single swift action per turn,\nregardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action\nany time you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift\nactions usually involve psionics or the activation of psionic items;\nmany characters (especially those who don&rsquo;t use psionics) never\nhave an\nopportunity to take a swift action.\n    <p>{`Manifesting a quickened power is a swift action.

However, unlike a swift action, an immediate action can\nbe performed at any time - even if it&rsquo;s not your turn. Using an\nimmediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift action, and\ncounts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another\nimmediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you\nhave used an immediate action when it is not currently your turn\n(effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent\nto using your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an\nimmediate action if you are currently flat-footed.</p>\n    <a id=\"range\"></a><h5>RANGE</h5>\nA power&rsquo;s range indicates how far from you it can reach, as\ndefined in\nthe Range entry of the power description. A power&rsquo;s range is the\nmaximum distance from you that the power&rsquo;s effect can occur, as\nwell as\nthe maximum distance at which you can designate the power&rsquo;s point\nof\norigin.

You manifest these powers on\ncreatures or objects, as defined by the power itself. You must be able\nto see or touch the target, and you must specifically choose that\ntarget. However, you do not have to select your target until you finish\nmanifesting the power.</p>\n    <p>If you manifest a targeted power on the wrong type of target\nthe power has no effect. If the target of a power is yourself (the\npower description has a line that reads &ldquo;Target: You&rdquo;), you\ndo not\nreceive a saving throw and power resistance does not apply. The Saving\nThrow and Power Resistance lines are omitted from such powers.</p>\n    <p>Some powers can be manifested only on willing targets.\nDeclaring yourself as a willing target is something that can be done at\nany time (even if you&rsquo;re flat-footed or it isn&rsquo;t your\nturn). <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Unconscious</a> creatures are\nautomatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but\nimmobile or <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#helpless\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>helpless</a> (such as one who is\nbound, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#cowering\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>cowering</a>, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#grappling\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>grappling</a>, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#paralyzed\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>paralyzed</a>, <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#pinned\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>pinned</a>, or <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>stunned</a>) is not automatically\nwilling.

The effect\ncan extend around corners and into areas that you can&rsquo;t see.\nFigure\ndistance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the\neffect may take. When determining distance for spread effects, count\naround walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace\ndiagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for\nsuch an effect (unless the effect is centered on you), but you need not\nhave line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.</p>\n    <a id=\"shapeable\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>(S) Shapeable:</span> If an\nEffect line ends with &ldquo;(S)&rdquo; you can shape the power.

Sometimes a power description specifies a specially\ndefined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories\ndefined below.</p>\n    <p>Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point\nwhere the power originates, but otherwise you usually don&rsquo;t\ncontrol\nwhich creatures or objects the power affects. The point of origin of a\npower that affects an area is always a grid intersection. When\ndetermining whether a given creature is within the area of a power,\ncount out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you\ndo when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged\nattack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center\nof one square to the center of the next, you count from intersection to\nintersection.</p>\n    <p>You can count diagonally across a square, but every second\ndiagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square\nis within the power&rsquo;s area, anything within that square is within\nthe\npower&rsquo;s area. If the power&rsquo;s area touches only the near\nedge of a\nsquare, however, anything within that square is unaffected by the power.</p>\n    <a id=\"burst-emanation-or-spread\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontStyle\": \"italic\"\n      }}>Burst, Emanation, or Spread:</span>\nMost powers that affect an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a\nspread. In each case, you select the power&rsquo;s point of origin and\nmeasure its effect from that point. A burst power affects whatever it\ncatches in its area, even including creatures that you can&rsquo;t see.\nIt\ncan&rsquo;t affect creatures with total cover from its point of origin\n(in\nother words, its effects don&rsquo;t extend around corners). The\ndefault\nshape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst powers are\nspecifically described as cone-shaped.</p>\n    <p>A burst&rsquo;s area defines how far from the point of origin\nthe\npower&rsquo;s effect extends.</p>\n    <p>An emanation power functions like a burst power, except that\nthe effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the\nduration of the power.</p>\n    <p>A spread power spreads out like a burst but can turn corners.\nYou select the point of origin, and the power spreads out a given\ndistance in all directions. Figure the area the power effect fills by\ntaking into account any turns the effect takes.</p>\n    <a id=\"cone-line-or-sphere\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontStyle\": \"italic\"\n      }}>Cone, Line, or Sphere:</span>\nMost powers that affect an area have a particular shape, such as a\ncone, line, or sphere. A cone-shaped power shoots away from you in a\nquarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from any\ncorner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either\nbursts or emanations (see above), and thus won&rsquo;t go around\ncorners.</p>\n    <p>A line-shaped power shoots away from you in a line in the\ndirection you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and\nextends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that\nblocks line of effect. A line-shaped power affects all creatures in\nsquares that the line passes through or touches.</p>\n    <p>A sphere-shaped power expands from its point of origin to fill\na spherical area.

You must\nhave a clear line of effect to any target that you manifest a power on\nor to any space in which you wish to create an effect. You must have a\nclear line of effect to the point of origin of any power you manifest.</p>\n    <p>A burst, cone, or emanation power affects only an area,\ncreatures, or objects to which it has line of effect from its origin (a\nspherical burst&rsquo;s center point, a cone-shaped burst&rsquo;s\nstarting point,\nor an emanation&rsquo;s point of origin). An otherwise solid barrier\nwith a\nhole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a\npower&rsquo;s line\nof effect.

If your power is being\nresisted by a creature with power resistance, you must make a\nmanifester level check (d20 + manifester level) at least equal to the\ncreature&rsquo;s power resistance for the power to affect that\ncreature. The\ndefender&rsquo;s power resistance functions like an Armor Class against\npsionic attacks. Spell resistance is equivalent to power resistance\nunless the Psionics Is Different option is in use. Include any\nadjustments to your manifester level on this manifester level check.\n    <p>The Power Resistance line and the descriptive text of a power\ndescription tell you whether power resistance protects creatures from\nthe power. In many cases, power resistance applies only when a\nresistant creature is targeted by the power, not when a resistant\ncreature encounters a power that is already in place.</p>\n    <p>The terms &ldquo;object&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; mean\nthe same thing for\npower\nresistance as they do for saving throws. A creature with power\nresistance must voluntarily lower the resistance (a standard action) to\nbe affected by a power noted as harmless. In such a case, you do not\nneed to make the manifester level check described above.</p>\n    <a id=\"power-points\"></a><h5>POWER POINTS</h5>\nAll powers have a Power Points line, indicating the power&rsquo;s cost.\n    <p>The psionic character class tables show how many power points\na\ncharacter has access to each day, depending on level.</p>\n    <p>A power&rsquo;s cost is determined by its level, as shown\nbelow.\nEvery\npower&rsquo;s cost is noted in its description for ease of reference.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-power-points-by-power-level\"></a><span style={{\n      \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n    }}>Table: Power Points by Power\nLevel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    </span>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td><span style={{\n              \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n            }}>Power Level</span>\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>1\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>2\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>3\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>4\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>5\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>6\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>7\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>8\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n            \"width\": \"20px\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>9\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style={{\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}><span style={{\n              \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n            }}>Power Point Cost</span>\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>1\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>3\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>5\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>7\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>9\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>11\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>13\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>15\n          </td>\n          <td style={{\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"top\",\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\"\n          }}>17\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <a id=\"power-point-limit\"></a><span style={{\n      \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n    }}>Power Point Limit:</span> Some\npowers allow you to spend more than their base\ncost to achieve an improved effect, or augment the power.
