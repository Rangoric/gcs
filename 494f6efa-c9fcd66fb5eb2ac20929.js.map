status. Many\ndungeons are variations on these basic types or combinations of more\nthan one of them. Sometimes old dungeons are used again and again by\ndifferent inhabitants for different purposes.\n    <a id=\"ruined-structure\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Ruined Structure:</span> Once\noccupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its\noriginal creator or creators, and other creatures have wandered in.\nMany subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground\nconstructions in which to make their lairs. Any traps that might exist\nhave probably been set off, but wandering beasts might very well be\ncommon.</p>\n    <a id=\"occupied-structure\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Occupied Structure:</span>\nThis type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent)\nlive there, although they may not be the dungeon&rsquo;s creators. An\noccupied structure might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active\nmine, a prison, or a headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely\nto have traps or wandering beasts, and more likely to have organized\nguards-both on watch and on patrol. Traps or wandering beasts that\nmight be encountered are usually under the control of the occupants.\nOccupied structures have furnishings to suit the inhabitants, as well\nas decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to move around\n(doors they can open, hallways large enough for them to pass through,\nand so on). The inhabitants might have a communication system, and they\nalmost certainly control an access to the outside.</p>\n    <p>Some dungeons are partially occupied and partially empty or in\nruins. In such cases, the occupants are typically not the original\nbuilders but instead a group of intelligent creatures that have set up\ntheir base, lair, or fortification within an abandoned dungeon.</p>\n    <a id=\"safe-storage\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Safe Storage:</span> When\npeople want to protect something, they might bury it underground.\nWhether the item they want to protect is a fabulous treasure, a\nforbidden artifact, or the dead body of an important figure, these\nvaluable objects are placed within a dungeon and surrounded by\nbarriers, traps, and guardians.</p>\n    <p>The safe storage type of dungeon is the most likely to have\ntraps but the least likely to have wandering beasts. This type of\ndungeon normally is built for function rather than appearance, but\nsometimes it has ornamentation in the form of statuary or painted\nwalls. This is particularly true of the tombs of important people.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes, however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such\na way as to house living guardians. The problem with this strategy is\nthat something must be done to keep the creatures alive between\nintrusion attempts. Magic is usually the best solution to provide food\nand water for these creatures. Even if there&rsquo;s no way anything\nliving\ncan survive in a safe storage dungeon, certain monsters can still serve\nas guardians. Builders of vaults or tombs often place undead creatures\nor constructs, both of which which have no need for sustenance or rest,\nto guard their dungeons. Magic traps can attack intruders by summoning\nmonsters into the dungeon. These guardians also need no sustenance,\nsince they appear only when they&rsquo;re needed and disappear when\ntheir\ntask is done.</p>\n    <a id=\"natural-cavern-complex\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Natural Cavern Complex:</span>\nUnderground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean monsters.\nCreated naturally and connected by a labyrinthine tunnel system, these\ncaverns lack any sort of pattern, order, or decoration.

Subterranean predators prowl these\nforests, looking for those feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of\nfungus give off a phosphorescent glow, providing a natural cavern\ncomplex with its own limited light source. In other areas, a <a href=\"spellsDtoE.html#daylight\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>daylight</a>\nspell or similar magical effect can provide enough light for green\nplants to grow.</p>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Often, a natural cavern complex connects with\nanother type of dungeons, the caves having been discovered when the\nmanufactured dungeon was delved. A cavern complex can connect two\notherwise unrelated dungeons, sometimes creating a strange mixed\nenvironment.

Caves rarely\nhave flat surfaces of any great size. Rather, their floors have many\nlevels. Some adjacent floor surfaces might vary in elevation by only a\nfoot, so that moving from one to the other is no more difficult than\nnegotiating a stair step, but in other places the floor might suddenly\ndrop off or rise up several feet or more, requiring Climb checks to get\nfrom one surface to the other. Unless a path has been worn and well\nmarked in the floor of a natural cave, it takes 2 squares of movement\nto enter a square with a natural stone floor, and the DC of Balance and\nTumble checks increases by 5.

Many grates have hinges to allow access to what lies below\n(such grates can be locked like any door), while others are permanent\nand designed not to move. A typical 1-inch-thick iron grate has 25 hit\npoints, hardness 10, and a DC of 27 for Strength checks to break\nthrough it or tear it loose.</p>\n    <a id=\"ledge\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Ledge:</span> Ledges allow\ncreatures to walk above some lower area. They often circle around pits,\nrun along underground streams, form balconies around large rooms, or\nprovide a place for archers to stand while firing upon enemies below.\nNarrow ledges (12 inches wide or less) require those moving along them\nto make Balance checks. Failure results in the moving character falling\noff the ledge. Ledges sometimes have railings. In such a case,\ncharacters gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Balance checks to move along\nthe ledge. A character who is next to a railing gains a +2 circumstance\nbonus on his or her opposed Strength check to avoid being bull rushed\noff the edge.</p>\n    <p>Ledges can also have low walls 2 to 3 feet high along their\nedges.

If such a floor\nslides\nquickly enough that there&rsquo;s a chance of a character falling into\nwhatever lies beneath-a spiked pit, a vat of burning oil, or a pool\nfilled with sharks-then it&rsquo;s a trap.</p>\n    <a id=\"trap-floors\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Trap Floors:</span> Some\nfloors are designed to become suddenly dangerous.

Good doors (break DC 16), while\nsturdy and long-lasting, are still not meant to take much punishment.\nStrong doors (break DC 23) are bound in iron and are a sturdy barrier\nto those attempting to get past them. Iron hinges fasten the door to\nits frame, and typically a circular pull-ring in the center is there to\nhelp open it. Sometimes, instead of a pull-ring, a door has an iron\npull-bar on one or both sides of the door to serve as a handle.

Builtin locks\neither control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall\nof its frame, or else a sliding iron bar or heavy wooden bar that rests\nbehind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but\nusually run through two rings, one on the door and the other on the\nwall. More complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks,\nare usually built into the door itself.

A door can\nhave more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately.\nLocks are often trapped, usually with poison needles that extend out to\nprick a rogue&rsquo;s finger.</p>\n    <p>Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole\ndoor. If a PC wants to whack at a lock with a weapon, treat the typical\nlock as having hardness 15 and 30 hit points. A lock can only be broken\nif it can be attacked separately from the door, which means that a\nbuilt-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In an occupied\ndungeon, every locked door should have a key somewhere. </p>\n    <p>A special door (see below for examples) might have a lock with\nno key, instead requiring that the right combination of nearby levers\nmust be manipulated or the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in\nthe correct sequence to open the door.</p>\n    <a id=\"stuck-doors\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Stuck Doors:</span> Dungeons\nare often damp, and sometimes doors get stuck, particularly wooden\ndoors.

The advantages of pivots is that they can&rsquo;t be dismantled\nlike\nhinges and they&rsquo;re simple to make. The disadvantage is that since\nthe\ndoor pivots on its center of gravity (typically in the middle), nothing\nlarger than half the door&rsquo;s width can fit through. Doors with\npivots\nare usually stone and are often quite wide to overcome this\ndisadvantage. Another solution is to place the pivot toward one side\nand have the door be thicker at that end and thinner toward the other\nend so that it opens more like a normal door. Secret doors in walls\noften turn on pivots, since the lack of hinges makes it easier to hide\nthe door&rsquo;s presence. Pivots also allow objects such as bookcases\nto be\nused as secret doors.</p>\n    <a id=\"secret-doors\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Secret Doors:</span>\nDisguised as a bare patch of wall (or floor, or ceiling), a bookcase, a\nfireplace, or a fountain, a secret door leads to a secret passage or\nroom.

Secret doors can open like normal\ndoors, or they may pivot, slide, sink, rise, or even lower like a\ndrawbridge to permit access. Builders might put a secret door down low\nnear the floor or high up in a wall, making it difficult to find or\nreach.

For the same\nreason, magic traps such as <a href=\"spellsFtoG.html#glyph-of-warding\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>glyphs of warding</a> are effective\nin hallways as well.</p>\n    <a id=\"mazes\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Mazes:</span> Usually,\npassages connect chambers in the simplest and straightest manner\npossible.

Put a\nberm on the map by drawing two adjacent rows of steep slope (described\nin Hills Terrain, above), with the edges of the berm on the downhill\nside. Thus, a character crossing a two-square berm will travel uphill\nfor 1 square, then downhill for 1 square. Two square berms provide\ncover as low walls for anyone standing behind them. Larger berms\nprovide the low wall benefit for anyone standing 1 square downhill from\nthe top of the berm. </p>\n    <a id=\"plains-fences\"></a><p><b>Fences</b>: Wooden fences are generally used to contain\nlivestock or impede oncoming soldiers.

A\ncity, on the other hand, is held together by a code of laws, many of\nwhich are explicitly designed to prevent the sort of behavior that\nadventurers engage in all the time: killing and looting. Even so, most\ncities&rsquo; laws recognize monsters as a threat to the stability the city\nrelies on, and prohibitions about murder rarely apply to monsters such\nas aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however, are\ntypically protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens of\nthe city. Having an evil alignment is not a crime (except in some\nseverely theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up\nthe law); only evil deeds are against the law. Even when adventurers\nencounter an evildoer in the act of perpetrating some heinous evil upon\nthe populace of the city, the law tends to frown on the sort of\nvigilante justice that leaves the evildoer dead or otherwise unable to\ntestify at a trial.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"weapon-and-spell-restrictions\"></a>Weapon And Spell Restrictions</h6>\nDifferent cities have different laws about such issues as carrying weapons in public and restricting spellcasters.\n    <p>The\ncity&rsquo;s laws may not affect all characters equally.

Few cities have enough guards to keep someone constantly\nstationed at every tower, unless the city is expecting attack from\noutside. The towers provide a superior view of the surrounding\ncountryside as well as a point of defense against invaders.\nWatch\ntowers are typically 10 feet higher than the wall they adjoin, and\ntheir diameter is 5 times the thickness of the wall. <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }} href=\"#walls-with-arrow-slits\">Arrow slits</a> line\nthe outer sides of the upper stories of a tower, and the top is\ncrenellated like the surrounding walls are.

Because the catapult throws its payload in a\nhigh arc, it can hit squares out of its line of sight. To fire a heavy\ncatapult, the crew chief makes a special check against DC 15 using only\nhis base attack bonus, Intelligence modifier, range increment penalty,\nand the appropriate modifiers from the lower section of Table: Siege Engines . If\nthe check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was\naimed at, dealing the indicated damage to any object or character in\nthe square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save take half\ndamage. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots hit the\nsame square unless the catapult is reaimed or the wind changes\ndirection or speed.</p>\n    <p>If a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to\ndetermine where it lands. This determines the misdirection of the\nthrow, with 1 being back toward the catapult and 2 through 8 counting\nclockwise around the target square.

Most adventuring activity\nis impossible under such conditions.</p>\n    <a id=\"tornado\"></a><p><i>Tornado</i>: One in ten thunderstorms is accompanied by a\ntornado.</p>\n    <a id=\"fog\"></a><h6>Fog</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Whether in the form of a low-lying cloud or a\nmist rising from the ground, fog obscures all sight, including\ndarkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment\n(attacks by or against them have a 20% miss chance).</p>\n    <a id=\"winds\"></a><h6>Winds</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The wind can create a stinging spray of sand\nor dust, fan a large fire, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or\nvapors away. If powerful enough, it can even knock characters down (see\nTable: Wind Effects), interfere with ranged attacks, or impose\npenalties on some skill checks.</p>\n    <a id=\"light-wind\"></a><p><i>Light Wind</i>: A gentle breeze, having little or no game\neffect.</p>\n    <a id=\"moderate-wind\"></a><p><i>Moderate Wind</i>: A steady wind with a 50% chance of\nextinguishing small, unprotected flames, such as candles.</p>\n    <a id=\"strong-wind\"></a><p><i>Strong Wind</i>: Gusts that automatically extinguish\nunprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). Such gusts impose\na &ndash;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and on Listen checks.</p>\n    <a id=\"severe-wind\"></a><p><i>Severe Wind</i>: In addition to automatically extinguishing\nany unprotected flames, winds of this magnitude cause protected flames\n(such as those of lanterns) to dance wildly and have a 50% chance of\nextinguishing these lights. Ranged weapon attacks and Listen checks are\nat a &ndash;4 penalty. This is the velocity of wind produced by a\n      <a href=\"spellsFtoG.html#gust-of-wind\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>gust of wind</a> spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"windstorm\"></a><p><i>Windstorm</i>: Powerful enough to bring down branches if\nnot whole trees, windstorms automatically extinguish unprotected flames\nand have a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames, such as those of\nlanterns. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons\nhave a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls. Listen checks are at a\n&ndash;8 penalty\ndue to the howling of the wind. </p>\n    <a id=\"hurricane-force-wind\"></a><p><i>Hurricane-Force Wind</i>: All flames are extinguished.\nRanged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons, which have a\n&ndash;8 penalty on attack rolls). Listen checks are impossible: All\ncharacters can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force winds\noften fell trees.</p>\n    <a id=\"tornado-cr-10\"></a><p><i>Tornado (CR 10)</i>: All flames are extinguished. All\nranged attacks are impossible (even with siege weapons), as are Listen\nchecks. Instead of being <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#blown-away\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>blown away</a> (see Table: Wind\nEffects),\ncharacters in close proximity to a tornado who fail their Fortitude\nsaves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact with the\nactual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds,\ntaking 6d6 points of damage per round, before being violently expelled\n(falling damage may apply). While a tornado&rsquo;s rotational speed\ncan be\nas great as 300 mph, the funnel itself moves forward at an average of\n30 mph (roughly 250 feet per round). A tornado uproots trees, destroys\nbuildings, and causes other similar forms of major destruction.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-wind-effects\"></a><p><b>Table: WIND EFFECTS</b></p>\n    <table border=\"0\"

However, the\nDC of the check increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive. </p>\n    <a id=\"falling-objects\"></a><h5>FALLING OBJECTS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Just as characters take damage when they fall\nmore than 10 feet, so too do they take damage when they are hit by\nfalling objects.</p>\n    <p>Objects that fall upon characters deal damage based on their\nweight and the distance they have fallen.</p>\n    <p>For each 200 pounds of an object&rsquo;s weight, the object\ndeals\n1d6 points of damage, provided it falls at least 10 feet. Distance also\ncomes into play, adding an additional 1d6 points of damage for every\n10-foot increment it falls beyond the first (to a maximum of 20d6\npoints of damage).</p>\n    <p>Objects smaller than 200 pounds also deal damage when dropped,\nbut they must fall farther to deal the same damage. Use Table: Damage\nfrom Falling Objects to see how far an object of a given weight must\ndrop to deal 1d6 points of damage.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-damage-from-falling-objects\"></a><p><b>Table: DAMAGE FROM FALLING OBJECTS</b></p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"300px\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Object Weight</th>\n          <th>Falling Distance</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>200&ndash;101 lb.</td>\n          <td>20 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>100&ndash;51 lb.</td>\n          <td>30 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>50&ndash;31 lb.</td>\n          <td>40 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>30&ndash;11 lb.</td>\n          <td>50 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>10&ndash;6 lb.</td>\n          <td>60 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">5&ndash;1 lb.</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">70 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>For each additional increment an object falls, it deals an\nadditional 1d6 points of damage. Objects weighing less than 1 pound do\nnot deal damage to those they land upon, no matter how far they have\nfallen.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"heat-dangers\"></a>HEAT DANGERS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Heat deals nonlethal damage that cannot be\nrecovered until the character gets cooled off (reaches shade, survives\nuntil nightfall, gets doused in water, is targeted by endure elements,\nand so forth). Once rendered <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>unconscious</a> through the\naccumulation of\nnonlethal damage, the character begins to take lethal damage at the\nsame rate.</p>\n    <p>A character in very hot conditions (above 90&deg; F) must make\na Fortitude saving throw each hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check)\nor take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy\nclothing or armor of any sort take a &ndash;4 penalty on their saves. A\ncharacter with the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#survival\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Survival</a> skill may receive a\nbonus on this saving\nthrow and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well\n(see the skill description). Characters reduced to unconsciousness\nbegin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per hour).</p>\n    <p>In severe heat (above 110&deg; F), a character must make a\nFortitude save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for each previous\ncheck) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy\nclothing or armor of any sort take a &ndash;4 penalty on their saves. A\ncharacter with the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving\nthrow and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well.\nCharacters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4\npoints per each 10-minute period).</p>\n    <p>A character who takes any nonlethal damage from heat exposure\nnow suffers from heatstroke and is <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>fatigued</a>. These penalties end\nwhen\nthe character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the heat.</p>\n    <p>Extreme heat (air temperature over 140&deg; F, fire, boiling\nwater, lava) deals lethal damage. Breathing air in these temperatures\ndeals 1d6 points of damage per minute (no save). In addition, a\ncharacter must make a Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per\nprevious check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Those wearing\nheavy clothing or any sort of armor take a &ndash;4 penalty on their\nsaves.\nIn addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very\nhot metal are affected as if by a <a href=\"spellsHtoL.html#heat-metal\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>heat metal</a> spell.</p>\n    <p>Boiling water deals 1d6 points of scalding damage, unless the\ncharacter is fully immersed, in which case it deals 10d6 points of\ndamage per round of exposure.</p>\n    <a id=\"catching-on-fire\"></a><h6>Catching on Fire</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Characters exposed to burning oil, bonfires,\nand noninstantaneous magic fires might find their clothes, hair, or\nequipment on fire. Spells with an instantaneous duration don&rsquo;t\nnormally\nset a character on fire, since the heat and flame from these come and\ngo in a flash.</p>\n    <p>Characters at risk of catching fire are allowed a DC 15 Reflex\nsave to avoid this fate. If a character&rsquo;s clothes or hair catch\nfire,\nhe takes 1d6 points of damage immediately. In each subsequent round,\nthe burning character must make another Reflex saving throw. Failure\nmeans he takes another 1d6 points of damage that round. Success means\nthat the fire has gone out. (That is, once he succeeds on his saving\nthrow, he&rsquo;s no longer on fire.)</p>\n    <p>A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by\njumping into enough water to douse himself. If no body of water is at\nhand, rolling on the ground or smothering the fire with cloaks or the\nlike permits the character another save with a +4 bonus.</p>\n    <p>Those unlucky enough to have their clothes or equipment catch\nfire must make DC 15 Reflex saves for each item. Flammable items that\nfail take the same amount of damage as the character.</p>\n    <a id=\"lava-effects\"></a><h6>Lava Effects</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Lava or magma deals 2d6 points of damage per\nround of exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such as when\na character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which deals\n20d6 points of damage per round.</p>\n    <p>Damage from magma continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure\nceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt during\nactual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 points per round).</p>\n    <p>An immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity to\nlava or magma. However, a creature immune to fire might still drown if\ncompletely immersed in lava (see Drowning, below).</p>\n    <a id=\"smoke-effects\"></a><h5>SMOKE EFFECTS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A character who breathes heavy smoke must make\na Fortitude save each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend\nthat round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2\nconsecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.</p>\n    <p>Smoke obscures vision, giving concealment (20% miss chance) to\ncharacters within it.</p>\n    <a id=\"starvation-and-thirst\"></a><h5>STARVATION AND THIRST</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Characters might find themselves without food\nor water and with no means to obtain them. In normal climates, Medium\ncharacters need at least a gallon of fluids and about a pound of decent\nfood per day to avoid starvation. (Small characters need half as much.)\nIn very hot climates, characters need two or three times as much water\nto avoid dehydration.</p>\n    <p>A character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of\nhours equal to his Constitution score. After this time, the character\nmust make a Constitution check each hour (DC 10, +1 for each previous\ncheck) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.</p>\n    <p>A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing\ndiscomfort. After this time, the character must make a Constitution\ncheck each day (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points\nof nonlethal damage.</p>\n    <p>Characters who have taken nonlethal damage from lack of food\nor water are <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>fatigued</a>. Nonlethal damage from\nthirst or starvation\ncannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as\nneeded&mdash;not even magic that restores hit points heals this damage.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"suffocation\"></a>SUFFOCATION</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A character who has no air to breathe can hold\nher breath for 2 rounds per point of Constitution. After this period of\ntime, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check in order to\ncontinue holding her breath. The save must be repeated each round, with\nthe DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.</p>\n    <p>When the character fails one of these Constitution checks, she\nbegins to suffocate. In the first round, she falls <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>unconscious</a> (0 hit\npoints). In the following round, she drops to &ndash;1 hit points and\nis <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>dying</a>. In the third round, she\nsuffocates.</p>\n    <a id=\"slow-suffocation\"></a><p><b>Slow Suffocation</b>: A Medium character can breathe easily\nfor 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that\ntime, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15\nminutes. Each additional Medium character or significant fire source (a\ntorch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last.\nWhen a character falls unconscious from this nonlethal damage, she\ndrops to &ndash;1 hit points and is dying. In the next round, she\nsuffocates.\n    </p>\n    <p>Small characters consume half as much air as Medium\ncharacters. A larger volume of air, of course, lasts for a longer time.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"water-dangers\"></a>WATER DANGERS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Any character can wade in relatively calm\nwater that isn&rsquo;t over his head, no check required. Similarly,\nswimming\nin calm water only requires skill checks with a DC of 10. Trained\nswimmers can just take 10. (Remember, however, that armor or heavy gear\nmakes any attempt at swimming much more difficult. See the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#swim\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Swim</a>\nskill\ndescription.)</p>\n    <p>By contrast, fast-moving water is much more dangerous. On a\nsuccessful DC 15 Swim check or a DC 15 Strength check, it deals 1d3\npoints of nonlethal damage per round (1d6 points of lethal damage if\nflowing over rocks and cascades). On a failed check, the character must\nmake another check that round to avoid going under.</p>\n    <p>Very deep water is not only generally pitch black, posing a\nnavigational hazard, but worse, it deals water pressure damage of 1d6\npoints per minute for every 100 feet the character is below the\nsurface. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 for each previous\ncheck) means the diver takes no damage in that minute.</p>\n    <p>Very cold water deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from\nhypothermia per minute of exposure.</p>\n    <h6><a id=\"drowning\"></a>Drowning</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Any character can hold her breath for a number\nof rounds equal to twice her Constitution score. After this period of\ntime, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round in\norder to continue holding her breath. Each round, the DC increases by\n1. </p>\n    <p>When the character finally fails her Constitution check, she\nbegins to drown. In the first round, she falls <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>unconscious</a> (0 hp). In\nthe following round, she drops to &ndash;1 hit points and is <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>dying</a>. In the\nthird round, she drowns.</p>\n    <p>It is possible to drown in substances other than water, such\nas sand, quicksand, fine dust, and silos full of grain.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","id","cellSpacing","cellPadding","border","style","href","className","rowSpan","colSpan","valign","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
