In addition, some magic items are cursed or\nintelligent. Finally, a few magic items are of such rarity and power\nthat they are considered to belong to a category of their own:\nartifacts. Artifacts are classified in turn as minor (extremely rare\nbut not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one unique and extremely\npotent).</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-armor-and-shields\"></a><p><b>Armor and Shields</b>: Magic armor (including shields)\noffers improved, magical protection to the wearer. Some of these items\nconfer abilities beyond a benefit to Armor Class. </p>\n    <a id=\"magic-weapons\"></a><p><b>Weapons</b>: Magic weapons are created with a variety of\ncombat powers and almost always improve the attack and damage rolls of\nthe wielder as well.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-potions\"></a><p><b>Potions</b>: A potion is an elixir concocted with a\nspell-like effect that affects only the drinker.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-rings\"></a><p><b>Rings</b>: A ring is a circular metal band worn on the\nfinger (no more than two rings per wearer) that has a spell-like power\n(often a constant effect that affects the wearer).</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-rods\"></a><p><b>Rods</b>: A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power\nunlike that of any known spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-scrolls\"></a><p><b>Scrolls</b>: A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto\npaper or parchment so that it can be used later.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-staffs\"></a><p><b>Staffs</b>: A staff has a number of different (but often\nrelated) spell effects. A newly created staff has 50 charges, and each\nuse of the staff depletes one or more of those charges.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-wands\"></a><p><b>Wands</b>: A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to\ncast a specific spell. A newly created wand has 50 charges, and each\nuse of the wand depletes one of those charges.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-wondrous-items\"></a><p><b>Wondrous Items</b>: These objects include magic jewelry,\ntools, books, clothing, and much more.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-items-and-detect-magic\"></a><h6>Magic Items and Detect Magic</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When detect magic identifies a magic\nitem&rsquo;s\nschool of magic, this information refers to the school of the spell\nplaced within the potion, scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given\nfor the item. The description of each item provides its aura strength\nand the school it belongs to.</p>\n    <p>If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the\nhighest-level spell. If no spells are included in the prerequisites,\nuse the following default guidelines.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-magic-aura-guidelines\"></a><table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"250px\"\n          }}>Item Nature</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"100px\"\n          }}>School</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Armor and protection items</td>\n          <td>Abjuration</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Weapons or offensive items</td>\n          <td>Evocation</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Bonus to ability score, on skill check, etc.</td>\n          <td>Transmutation</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <a id=\"using-items\"></a><h5>USING ITEMS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">To use a magic item, it must be activated,\nalthough sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your\nfinger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases,\nusing an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks\nof opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like\nspells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <p>Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item\ndescription indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell\nis the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless\nof the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically\nstates otherwise.</p>\n    <p>The four ways to activate magic items are described below.</p>\n    <a id=\"spell-completion\"></a><p><b>Spell Completion</b>: This is the activation method for\nscrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation\nis done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as\nwith normal spellcasting. All that&rsquo;s left to do is perform the\nfinishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so\non). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high\nenough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he\ncan&rsquo;t\nalready cast the spell, there&rsquo;s a chance he&rsquo;ll make a\nmistake.\nActivating a spell completion item is a standard action and provokes\nattacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.</p>\n    <a id=\"spell-trigger\"></a><p><b>Spell Trigger</b>: Spell trigger activation is similar to\nspell completion, but it&rsquo;s even simpler. No gestures or spell\nfinishing\nis needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate\ncharacter would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Anyone\nwith a spell on his or her spell list knows how to use a spell trigger\nitem that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who\ncan&rsquo;t actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin.) The\nuser must\nstill determine what spell is stored in the item before she can\nactivate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and\ndoes not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <a id=\"command-word\"></a><p><b>Command Word</b>: If no activation method is suggested\neither in the magic item description or by the nature of the item,\nassume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word\nactivation means that a character speaks the word and the item\nactivates. No other special knowledge is needed.</p>\n    <p>A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case,\nthe holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item\naccidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often,\nthe command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or\nphrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a\ncommand word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke\nattacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written\nright on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or\ndesign engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item\nmight bear a clue to the command word.</p>\n    <p>The Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be\nuseful in helping to identify command words or deciphering clues\nregarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up\nwith the word itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second\ncheck (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue.</p>\n    <p>The spells identify and analyze dweomer both reveal command\nwords.</p>\n    <a id=\"use-activated\"></a><p><b>Use Activated</b>: This type of item simply has to be used\nin order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a\nsword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a\nlens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is\ngenerally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>\n    <p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears.\nContinually functioning items are practically always items that one\nwears. A few must simply be in the character&rsquo;s possession (on his\nperson). However, some items made for wearing must still be activated.\nAlthough this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above),\nusually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The\ndescription of an item states whether a command word is needed in such\na case.</p>\n    <p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item\nis either a standard action or not an action at all and does not\nprovoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an\naction that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of\nthe item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation\nis a standard action. If the item&rsquo;s activation is subsumed in its\nuse\nand takes no extra time use activation is not an action at all.</p>\n    <p>Use activation doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you use an item, you\nautomatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess)\nwhat the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it,\nunless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such from drinking\na potion or swinging a sword.</p>\n    <a id=\"size-and-magic-items\"></a><h5>SIZE AND MAGIC ITEMS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When an article of magic clothing or jewelry\nis discovered, most of the time size shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. Many\nmagic\ngarments are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves\nmagically to the wearer. Size should not keep characters of various\nkinds from using magic items.</p>\n    <p>There may be rare exceptions, especially with racial specific\nitems. </p>\n    <a id=\"armor-and-weapon-sizes\"></a><p><b>Armor and Weapon Sizes</b>: Armor and weapons that are\nfound at random have a 30% chance of being Small (01&ndash;30), a 60%\nchance\nof being Medium (31&ndash;90), and a 10% chance of being any other size\n(91&ndash;100).</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-items-on-the-body\"></a><h5>MAGIC ITEMS ON THE BODY</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Many magic items need to be donned by a\ncharacter who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities.\nIt&rsquo;s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear\nas\nmany as twelve magic items at the same time. However, each of those\nitems must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.</p>\n    <p>A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear\nconsisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to\nwhich place on the body the item is worn.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head</li>\n      <li>One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the eyes</li>\n      <li>One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab\naround the neck</li>\n      <li>One vest, vestment, or shirt on the torso</li>\n      <li>One robe or suit of armor on the body (over a vest,\nvestment, or shirt)</li>\n      <li>One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of armor)</li>\n      <li>One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a\nrobe or suit of armor)</li>\n      <li>One pair of bracers or bracelets on the arms or wrists</li>\n      <li>One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the hands</li>\n      <li>One ring on each hand (or two rings on one hand)</li>\n      <li>One pair of boots or shoes on the feet</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of\nthe same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those\nlisted above have no effect. </p>\n    <p>Some items can be worn or carried without taking up space on a\ncharacter&rsquo;s body. The description of an item indicates when an\nitem has\nthis property.</p>\n    <a id=\"saving-throws-against-magic-item-powers\"></a><h5>SAVING THROWS AGAINST MAGIC ITEM POWERS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Magic items produce spells or spell-like\neffects. For a saving throw against a spell or spell-like effect from a\nmagic item, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the\nability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level\nof spell. </p>\n    <p>Staffs are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as\nif the wielder cast the spell, including caster level and all modifiers\nto save DC. </p>\n    <p>Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various\neffects, particularly when the effect has no exact spell equivalent\n(making its level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).</p>\n    <a id=\"damaging-magic-items\"></a><h5>DAMAGING MAGIC ITEMS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A magic item doesn&rsquo;t need to make a\nsaving\nthrow unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the\neffect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items\nshould always get a saving throw against spells that might deal damage\nto them&mdash; even against attacks from which a nonmagical item would\nnormally get no chance to save. Magic items use the same saving throw\nbonus for all saves, no matter what the type (Fortitude, Reflex, or\nWill). A magic item&rsquo;s saving throw bonus equals 2 + one-half its\ncaster\nlevel (round down). The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic\nitems, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.</p>\n    <p>Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical\nitems of the same sort. A damaged magic item continues to function, but\nif it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.</p>\n    <a id=\"repairing-magic-items\"></a><h5>REPAIRING MAGIC ITEMS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Some magic items take damage over the course\nof an adventure. It costs no more to repair a magic item with the Craft\nskill than it does to repair its nonmagical counterpart. The make whole\nspell also repairs a damaged&mdash;but not completely\nbroken&mdash;magic item.</p>\n    <a id=\"intelligent-items\"></a><h5>INTELLIGENT ITEMS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Some magic items, particularly weapons, have\nan intelligence all their own. Only permanent magic items (as opposed\nto those with a single use or those with charges) can be intelligent.\n(This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are\nnever intelligent.)</p>\n    <p>In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence. </p>\n    <a id=\"cursed-items\"></a><h5>CURSED ITEMS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Some items are cursed&mdash;incorrectly made,\nor\ncorrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly\ndangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw,\nan inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly\ngenerated items are cursed 5% of the time. </p>\n    <a id=\"charges-doses-and-multiple-uses\"></a><h5>CHARGES, DOSES, AND MULTIPLE USES</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Many items, particularly wands and staffs, are\nlimited in power by the number of charges they hold. Normally, charged\nitems have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random\npart of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of\ncharges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number\nof charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges\nare left. </p>\n    <p>Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an\nitem is created, it is fully charged.) For an item that&rsquo;s\nworthless\nwhen its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged\nitems), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the\nnumber of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to\nits charges, only part of the item&rsquo;s value is based on the number\nof\ncharges left.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-item-descriptions\"></a><h3>MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Each general type of magic item gets an\noverall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.</p>\n    <p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random\ngeneration, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break\nDC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes\nthat the item is unattended and includes a &ndash;5 penalty for the\nitem&rsquo;s\neffective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the\ncreature&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier in place of the &ndash;5 penalty.</p>\n    <p>Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells\nand nothing else, don&rsquo;t get full-blown descriptions. Reference\nthe\nspell&rsquo;s description for details, modified by the form of the item\n(potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the\nminimum level required to cast it</p>\n    <p>Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and\neach of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end\nof the description.</p>\n    <a id=\"aura\"></a><p><b>Aura</b>: Most of the time, a detect magic spell will\nreveal the school of magic associated with a magic item and the\nstrength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable)\nis given at the beginning of the item&rsquo;s notational entry. See the\ndetect magic spell description for details.</p>\n    <a id=\"caster-level\"></a><p><b>Caster Level</b>: The next item in a notational entry gives\nthe caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster\nlevel determines the item&rsquo;s saving throw bonus, as well as range\nor\nother level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).\nIt also determines the level that must be contended with should the\nitem come under the effect of a dispel magic spell or similar\nsituation. This information is given in the form &ldquo;CL x,&rdquo;\nwhere &ldquo;CL&rdquo; is\nan abbreviation for caster level and &ldquo;x&rdquo; is an ordinal\nnumber\nrepresenting the caster level itself.</p>\n    <p>For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the\ncaster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored\nspell and not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items,\nthe caster level is determined by the creator. The minimum caster level\nis that which is needed to meet the prerequisites given.</p>\n    <a id=\"prerequisites\"></a><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Certain requirements must be met in\norder for a character to create a magic item. These include feats,\nspells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and\nrace or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given\nimmediately following the item&rsquo;s caster level.</p>\n    <p>A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has\nprepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer\nor bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger\nmagic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell\neffect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator\nmust expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell\ntrigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a\nprerequisite.</p>\n    <p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the\ncreation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the\nprerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.</p>\n    <p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they\nmust agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the\npurpose of determinations where the creator&rsquo;s level must be\nknown. The\ncharacter designated as the creator pays the XP required to make the\nitem.</p>\n    <p>Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one\nor more spells (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).\nWhen two spells at the end of a list are separated by &ldquo;or,&rdquo;\none of\nthose spells is required in addition to every other spell mentioned\nprior to the last two.</p>\n    <a id=\"market-price\"></a><p><b>Market Price</b>: This gold piece value, given following\nthe word &ldquo;Price,&rdquo; represents the price someone should\nexpect to pay to\nbuy the item. The market price for an item that can be constructed with\nan item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price\nfor any components (material or XP).</p>\n    <a id=\"cost-to-create\"></a><p><b>Cost to Create</b>: The next part of a notational entry is\nthe cost in gp and XP to create the item, given following the word\n&ldquo;Cost.&rdquo; This information appears only for items with\ncomponents\n(material or XP), which make their market prices higher than their base\nprices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base\ncost plus the costs of the components. Items without components do not\nhave a &ldquo;Cost&rdquo; entry.
