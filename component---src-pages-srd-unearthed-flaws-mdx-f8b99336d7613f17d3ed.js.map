Whereas a feat enables a character\nto be better than normal at performing a task (or even to do something\nthat normal characters can't), a flaw restricts a character's capabilities\nor imposes a penalty of some sort.\n    <p>\nA player may select up to two flaws when creating a character. After 1st\nlevel, a character cannot take on additional flaws unless the game master\nspecifically allows it (for examples of times when doing this might be\nappropriate, see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#unearthedTraits.html\">Character\nTraits</a>). Each flaw a player selects entitles his character to a bonus\nfeat. In other words, when you create a character, if you select two\nflaws, you can also take two bonus feats beyond those your character would\nbe normally entitled to.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nUnlike <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"unearthedTraits.html\">traits</a>, flaws\nare entirely negative in their impact on a character's capabilities.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"behind-the-curtain-creating-flaws\"></a>\nBEHIND THE CURTAIN: CREATING FLAWS\n    </h5>\nYou can create new flaws, but be careful: Flaws can unbalance your game.\nWhen creating flaws, keep a few issues in mind:\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>A flaw must have a numeric effect on a character's specific\ncapabilities. Flaws with primarily roleplaying or story effects have\nunpredictable effects on game balance.\n        </p></li>\n      <li><p>Flaws are generally bigger in magnitude than feats. That's because\nplayers always choose flaws that have the least impact on their\ncharacters, while taking feats that have the most. For example, while a\nfeat affecting skills grants a +2 bonus on two skills, its counterpart\nflaw might impose a -4 penalty on two skills.\n        </p></li>\n      <li><p>A flaw must have a meaningful effect regardless of character class or\nrole. That way, a player can't reduce the flaw's importance through\nmulticlassing. For instance, a flaw that only affects spellcasters might\nseem reasonable - but for nonspellcaster characters, the flaw likely proves\nmeaningless. Even if you restrict the selection of such feats to\ncharacters of specific classes, a player can easily select a spellcasting\nclass at 1st level, choose two flaws that apply to spellcasters, gain the\nbonus feats, multiclass into a nonspellcasting class at 2nd level and\nthereafter proceed as a primarily nonspellcasting character. The player\nhas sacrificed a level to gain two bonus feats, a tradeoff that appeals to\nsome players.\n        </p></li>\n      <li><p>Similarly, a flaw that penalizes a character's Charisma based\nskill checks only\nhas a significant impact on the party spokesperson - the quiet fighter or\nbarbarian likely won't feel any impact from the penalties.\n        </p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h5><a id=\"flaw-descriptions\"></a>\nFLAW DESCRIPTIONS\n    </h5>\nEach of the flaws described here has a specific game effect.
