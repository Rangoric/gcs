Each\ncharacter has a limited number of action points, and once an action point\nis spent, it is gone for good.\n    <h5><a id=\"behind-the-curtain-action-points\"></a>\nBEHIND THE CURTAIN: ACTION POINTS\n    </h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>Action points give players some control over poor die rolls. Although this\nhas little effect in an average encounter, it makes it a little more\nlikely that characters will survive extremely challenging encounters and\nless likely that a single character will fall to what would otherwise be a\nbalanced foe because of bad luck. A reserve of action points lets even\ncareful players expose their characters to more risks, heightening the\ngame�s tension and opening the door to even more heroic action. This\nvariant also makes it less likely that an entire adventuring group will\nfall victim to one powerful effect, such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsC.html#circle-of-death\">circle of death</a> or <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsC.html#cloudkill\">cloudkill</a>.\n      <p>\nAction points also make it more likely that the use of a character�s most\npotent abilities will be successful. For example, although its overall\neffect on an encounter might be minimal, few things frustrate a paladin\nmore than missing with a smite attack � an event that becomes less likely\nwhen using action points.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nThat said, action points can also lead characters to routinely get in over\ntheir heads (relying on action points to save themselves), and for GMs to\nunconsciously increase the difficulty of encounters (since characters are\nmore likely to succeed against foes of equal power). This is as fine as\nlong as the characters have a reserve of such points to spend � but if they\nrun out, encounters that would otherwise be merely challenging can become\nincredibly deadly. Keep the number of action points available to your\ncharacters in mind when designing encounters.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nFor GMs who are worried that action points increase the power level of\ncharacters without an offsetting cost, there�s an easy solution. Just\nthink of each action point as a one-use magic item with a broad range of\npossible effects. With that analogy, it becomes easy to justify reducing\nthe amount of treasure awarded to balance out the accrual of action\npoints. Note that this is merely a tool for GMs interested in carefully\nmonitoring character power levels; action points should never be for sale.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nAn action point is roughly equivalent to a magic item worth 100 gp per\ncharacter level (since the higher a character�s level, the more potent the\neffect).\n      </p></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"aquairing-action-points\"></a>\nACQUIRING ACTION POINTS\n    </h5>\nA beginning (1st-level) character starts the game with 5 action points. A\ncharacter above 1st level starts the game with a number of action points\nequal to 5 + 1/2 his current character level.\n    <p>\nEvery time a character advances, he gains a number of action points equal\nto 5 + 1/2 his new character level. Some prestige classes might allow a\nfaster rate of accrual, at the GM�s option.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"action-points-and-existing-games\"></a>\nAction Points and Existing Games\n    </h6>\nAdding action points to an existing campaign is easy, since characters\ndon�t need to make any special changes. Each character simply gains a\nnumber of action points equal to 5 + 1/2 his character level.\n    <h6><a id=\"npcs-and-action-points\"></a>\nNPCs and Action Points\n    </h6>\nMost NPCs probably shouldn�t have action points, due to the added\ncomplexity this would create. In the case of important villains or other\nsignificant characters, however, the GM may award them an appropriate\nnumber of action points to use against the player characters. A number of\naction points equal to 1/2 the NPC�s level is a good baseline.\n    <h5><a id=\"using-action-points\"></a>\nUSING ACTION POINTS\n    </h5>\nYou can spend 1 action point either to <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#add-to-a-roll\">add to a single d20 roll</a>, to <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#special-actions\">take a\nspecial action</a>, or to <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#improve-feats\">improve the use of a feat</a>.\n    <p>\nYou can spend 1 action point in a round. If you spend a point to use a\nspecial action (see below), you can�t spend another one in the same round\nto improve a die roll, and vice versa.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"add-to-a-roll\"></a>\nAdd to a Roll\n    </h6>\nWhen you spend 1 action point to improve a d20 roll, you add the result of\na 1d6 to your d20 roll (including attack rolls, saves,\nchecks, or any other roll of a d20) to help you meet or exceed the target\nnumber. You can declare the use of 1 action point to alter a d20 roll\nafter the roll is made, but only before the GM reveals the result of that\nroll. You can�t use an action point to alter the result of a d20 roll when\nyou are taking 10 or taking 20.\n    <p>\nDepending on character level (see table), a character might be able to\nroll more than one d6 when he spends 1 action point. If so, apply the\nhighest result and disregard the other rolls. A 15th-level character, for\ninstance, gets to roll 3d6 and take the best result of the three. So, if\nhe rolled a 1, 2, and 4, he would apply the 4 to his d20 roll.\n    </p>\n    <table cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <th>\nCharacter\nLevel\n        </th>\n        <th>\nAction Point\nDice Rolled\n        </th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td align=\"center\">\n1st-7th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n1d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n8th-14th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n2d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td align=\"center\">\n15th-20th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n3d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <h6><a id=\"special-actions\"></a>\nSpecial Actions\n    </h6>\nA character can perform certain tasks by spending an action point. In\naddition to the actions described below, some prestige classes or feats\n(see below) might allow the expenditure of action points in order to gain\nor activate specific abilities, at the GM�s option.\n    <p><b><a id=\"activate-class-ability\"></a>Activate Class Ability:</b>\nA character can spend 1 action point to gain another use of a class\nability that has a limited number of uses per day. For example, a monk\nmight spend an action point to gain another use of her stunning fist\nability, or a paladin might spend an action point to make an additional\nsmite attack.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"boost-defence\"></a>Boost Defense:</b>\nA character can spend 1 action point as a free action when\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"actionsInCombat.html#fighting-defensively\">fighting defensively</a>. This gives him double the normal benefits for\nfighting defensively for the entire round (+4 dodge bonus to AC; +6 if he has 5 or\nmore ranks in Tumble).\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"emulate-feat\"></a>Emulate Feat:</b>\nAt the beginning of a character�s turn, he may spend 1 action point as a\nfree action to gain the benefit of a feat he doesn�t have. He must meet the prerequisites\nof the feat. He gains the benefit until the beginning of his next turn.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"extra-attack\"></a>Extra attack:</b>\nDuring any round in which a character takes a full attack action, he may\nspend 1 action point to make an extra attack at his highest base attack\nbonus. Action points may be used in this way with both melee and ranged\nattacks.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"spell-boost\"></a>Spell Boost:</b>\nA character can spend 1 action point as a free action to increase\nthe effective caster level of one of his spells by 2. He must decide\nwhether or not to spend an action point in this manner before casting the\nspell.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"spell-recall\"></a>Spell Recall:</b>\nSpellcasters who prepare their spells in advance can spend 1 action point\nto recall any spell just cast. The spell can be cast again later with no\neffect on other prepared spells. This use of an action point is a free action and can only\nbe done in the same round that the spell is cast. Spontaneous spellcasters\nsuch as sorcerers and bards can spend 1 action point to cast a spell\nwithout using one of their daily spell slots. This use of an action point\nis a free action and can only be done as the spell is being cast.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"stable\"></a>Stable:</b>\nAny time a character is dying, he can spend 1 action point to become\nstable at his current hit point total.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"improving-feats\"></a>\nImproving Feats\n    </h6>\nThe use of action points opens up a whole range of possible feats.\nHowever, it�s easier on characters simply to improve existing feats to\ntake advantage of action points � that way, characters needn�t spend their\nprecious feat slots simply to gain the ability to use their action points.\nBelow are a few examples of how action points can be used with existing\nfeats. Unless otherwise stated, each effect requires a free action to activate\nand lasts 1 round.\n    <p><b><a id=\"blind-fight\"></a>Blind-Fight:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to negate your miss chance for a single\nattack.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"combat-expertise\"></a>Combat Expertise:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to double the bonus to Armor Class granted by\nthe feat. For example, if you take a penalty of -3 on your attack roll, you gain a\n+6 dodge bonus to AC.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"dodge\"></a>Dodge:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to increase the dodge bonus granted by the feat to +2.\nThe effect lasts for the entire encounter.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"improved-critical\"></a>Improved Critical:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to double your critical threat range. Since\ntwo doublings equals a tripling, this benefit increases your threat range\nfrom 19-20 to 18-20, from 17-20 to 15-20, or from 15-20 to 12-20,\nincluding the effect of your Improved Critical feat. This benefit stacks\nwith the benefit from Improved Critical, but not with other effects that\nincrease threat range.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"improved-initiative\"></a>Improved Initiative:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to double the bonus on initiative checks\ngranted by the feat, from +4 to +8.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"metamagic-feats\"></a>Metamagic Feats:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to add the effect of any one metamagic feat\nthat you have to a spell you are casting. The spell is cast at its normal\nlevel (without any level adjustment because of the feat) and takes no\nextra time to cast.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#heighten-spell\">Heighten Spell</a> automatically raises a spell�s effective level to the\nhighest level of spell you are capable of casting. For example, if a\n7th-level wizard with the Heighten Spell feat casts burning hands and\nspends 1 action point to heighten the spell, the spell is treated as if it\nwere a 4th-level spell in all respects even though the wizard prepared it\nnormally (as a 1st-level spell).\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"power-attack\"></a>Power Attack:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to double the bonus on damage rolls granted\nby the feat. For example, if you take a penalty of -3 on your attack roll, you add +6\nto your damage roll.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"spell-focus\"></a>Spell Focus:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to double the increase to save DCs granted by\nthe feat, from +1 to +2.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"spell-penetration\"></a>Spell Penetration:</b>\nYou can spend 1 action point to double the bonus on caster level\nchecks granted by the feat, from +2 to +4.
