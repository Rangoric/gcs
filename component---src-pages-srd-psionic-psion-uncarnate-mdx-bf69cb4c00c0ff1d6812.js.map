While uncarnate, the character gains the incorporeal subtype\n(see below). He gains a fly speed equal to his land speed (perfect\nmaneuverability). His material armor remains in place and continues to\nprovide its armor bonus to AC (see Uncarnate Armor, above). His\nmaterial weapons also remain corporeal. Losing his physical form allows\nthe character to more easily access his mental abilities, and he gains\na +1 bonus on all save DCs for powers he manifests while uncarnate.\nHe can use equipment normally, deriving benefits from items that\nenhance his capabilities; however, all his equipment remains material\neven when the character is uncarnate (but see the assume equipment\nability, described below).\nOften, a psion uncarnate appears almost like a ghost wearing items of\nthe material world. This doesn&#8217;t make his equipment more susceptible to\nattack (the normal rules for attended objects apply), but it does make\nit impossible for the character to enter or pass through solid objects\nwhile wearing solid equipment. If he drops his material equipment, he\ncan pass through solid objects at will as described below.\nAt 6th level and higher, a psion uncarnate can shed his body twice per\nday for up to 1 minute each time. </p>\n    <a id=\"psion-uncarnate-incorporeal-subtype\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontStyle\": \"italic\"\n      }}>Incorporeal Subtype:</span>\nAn incorporeal psion uncarnate has no physical body. He can be harmed\nonly by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that\nstrike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or\nsupernatural abilities. He is immune to all nonmagical attack forms.\nEven when hit by spells or magic weapons, he has a 50% chance to ignore\nany damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy,\nnegative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch\nweapons).\nAn incorporeal psion uncarnate has no natural armor bonus - and, unlike\nother incorporeal creatures, does not gain a deflection bonus from his\nCharisma modifier. An incorporeal psion uncarnate can enter or pass\nthrough solid objects (subject to the restrictions described in the\nshed body and assume equipment abilities), but must remain adjacent to\nthe object&#8217;s exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object\nwhose space is larger than his own. He can sense the presence of\ncreatures or objects within a square adjacent to his current location,\nbut enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an\nincorporeal psion uncarnate that is inside an object. To see farther\nfrom the object he is in and attack normally, the incorporeal psion\nuncarnate must emerge. An incorporeal psion uncarnate inside an object\nhas total cover, but when he attacks a creature outside the object he\nonly has cover, so a creature outside with a readied action could\nstrike at him as he attacks. An incorporeal psion uncarnate cannot pass\nthrough a force effect.\nAn incorporeal psion uncarnate&#8217;s attacks pass through (ignore) natural\narmor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force\neffects work normally against him. He can pass through and operate in\nwater as easily as he does in air. An incorporeal psion uncarnate\ncannot fall or take falling damage. He cannot make <a href=\"specialAttacks.html#trip\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>trip</a>\nor <a href=\"specialAttacks.html#grapple\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>grapple</a>\nattacks, nor can he be tripped or grappled. In fact, he cannot take any\nphysical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its\nequipment, nor is he subject to such actions.\nIncorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are\ntriggered by weight. An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot\nbe heard with <a href=\"skillsAll.html#listen\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Listen</a> checks if it doesn&#8217;t wish\nto be. It has no\nStrength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee\nattack rolls and its ranged attack rolls.

This has no effect on the equipment&#8217;s function, but now when\nthe psion uncarnate is incorporeal, he can enter or pass through solid\nobjects while wearing nothing other than the designated equipment. Once\ndesignated, the equipment automatically changes to incorporeal when the\ncharacter sheds his body, and it returns to corporeality when the\ncharacter does. The character can change his designations as he desires.</p>\n    <a id=\"psion-uncarnate-assume-likeness\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Assume Likeness (Su):</span>\nAt 4th level and higher, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can\nassume the likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a\nstandard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The\ncharacter&#8217;s abilities do not change, but he appears to be the creature\nthat he assumes the likeness of, allowing him the ability to\neffectively disguise himself and bluff those who might wonder at his\ntrue nature. Each physical interaction with a creature requires a\nsuccessful <a href=\"skillsAll.html#bluff\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Bluff</a> check (opposed by the\ncreature&#8217;s <a href=\"skillsAll.html#sense-motive\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Sense Motive </a>check)\nto convince the creature of the psion uncarnate&#8217;s new appearance. The\npsion uncarnate must not do anything to give away his true\n(incorporeal) nature in order for the bluff to be successful; for\ninstance, if he accepts an item from another creature only to have it\nfall through his immaterial hands, the Bluff check automatically fails.\nHowever, a Bluff check would be allowed if the psion uncarnate uses his\ntelekinetic force ability (see below) to hold the received item.\nWhen using his assume likeness ability, a psion uncarnate has an\nadditional +10 circumstance bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#disguise\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Disguise</a> checks. If he can read\nan\nopponent&#8217;s mind, he gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and\nDisguise checks.</p>\n    <a id=\"psion-uncarnate-telekinetic-force\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Telekinetic Force (Su):</span>\nBeginning at 7th level, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can use a <a href=\"psionicPowersQtoW.html#telekinetic-force\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>telekinetic force</a> effect as a\nstandard action that does not provoke\nattacks of opportunity. The save DC is equal to 14 + the psion\nuncarnate&#8217;s key ability modifier (either Int, Wis, or Cha). The\ncharacter&#8217;s manifester level is the manifester level of the effect.\nEven while corporeal, a psion uncarnate can use this ability, but only\nthree times per day (uses while he is uncarnate do not count against\nthis use limit).</p>\n    <a id=\"psion-uncarnate-uncarnate-bridge\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Uncarnate Bridge (Su):</span>\nAt 8th level, as a creature of almost pure mind, a psion uncarnate\nbecomes more closely attuned to the minds of other creatures. He gains\nthe ability to transport himself via the minds of living creatures.\nOnce per day as a standard action while incorporeal, he can seamlessly\nenter any living creature with an Intelligence score and pass to\nanother living creature with an Intelligence score that is within line\nof sight of the first creature.\nThe psion uncarnate must be in a space adjacent to the entry creature\nbefore transporting, and he appears in a space adjacent to the\ndestination creature after transporting. The entry and destination\ncreatures need not be familiar to the character. A psion uncarnate\ncannot use himself as the entry or destination creature. Neither\ncreature need be a willing participant.\nWhen exiting the destination creature, the psion uncarnate chooses an\nadjacent square in which to appear. Entering and leaving a creature is\npainless, unless the psion uncarnate wishes otherwise (see below). In\nmost cases, though, the destination creature finds being the endpoint\nof a mental bridge surprising and quite unsettling.\nIf he desires, a psion uncarnate can destructively exit the destination\ncreature. If the creature fails a Will save (DC 15 + psion uncarnate&#8217;s\nkey ability modifier), the exiting psion uncarnate tunes his mental\nform to destructively interfere with the target&#8217;s mind. He bursts forth\nexplosively from the creature&#8217;s body, dealing it 10d6 points of damage.</p>\n    <a id=\"psion-uncarnate-uncarnate\"></a><p><span style={{\n        \"fontWeight\": \"bold\"\n      }}>Uncarnate (Ex):</span> At\n10th level, a psion uncarnate becomes a being of pure psionic\nconsciousness. This ability is similar to shed body, except the\ncharacter is permanently incorporeal (and gains that subtype). If the\ncharacter desires, he can become corporeal once per day for up to 1\nminute, but he spends the rest of his time as an entity of mind\nuntethered by the physical world.\n    </p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
