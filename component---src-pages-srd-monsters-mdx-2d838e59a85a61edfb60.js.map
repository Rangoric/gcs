The descriptive text may provide other names.</p>\n    <a id=\"size-and-type\"></a><h6>Size and Type</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line describes the creature&#8217;s size. A\nsize modifier applies to the creature&#8217;s Armor Class (AC) and attack\nbonus, as well as to certain skills. A creature&#8217;s size also determines\nhow far it can reach to make a melee attack and how much space it\noccupies in a fight (see Space/Reach, below). </p>\n    <p>The size and type line continues with the creature&#8217;s type.\nType determines how magic affects a creature. Type determines certain\nfeatures, such as Hit Dice size, base attack bonus, base saving throw\nbonuses, and skill points. </p>\n    <a id=\"hit-dice\"></a><h6>Hit Dice</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line gives the creature&#8217;s number and type\nof Hit Dice, and lists any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives\nthe average hit points for a creature of the indicated number of Hit\nDice. A creature&#8217;s Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for\ndetermining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural\nhealing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.</p>\n    <a id=\"initiative\"></a><h6>Initiative</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line gives the creature&#8217;s modifier on\ninitiative checks.</p>\n    <a id=\"speed\"></a><h6>Speed</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line gives the creature&#8217;s tactical speed\non land (the amount of distance it can cover in one move action). If\nthe creature wears armor that reduces its speed, the creature&#8217;s base\nland speed follows.</p>\n    <p>If the creature has other modes of movement, these are given\nafter (or in place of) the land speed. Unless noted otherwise, modes of\nmovement are natural (not magical).</p>\n    <a id=\"armor-class\"></a><h6>Armor Class</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The Armor Class line gives the creature&#8217;s AC\nfor normal combat and includes a parenthetical mention of the modifiers\ncontributing to it (usually size, Dexterity, and natural armor). The\ncreature&#8217;s touch and flat-footed ACs follow the combat-ready AC.</p>\n    <p>A creature&#8217;s armor proficiencies (if it has any) depend on its\ntype, but in general a creature is automatically proficient with any\nkind of armor it is described as wearing (light, medium, or heavy), and\nwith all lighter kinds of armor.</p>\n    <a id=\"base-attack-grapple\"></a><h6>Base Attack/Grapple</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The number before the slash on this line is\nthe creature&#8217;s base attack bonus (before any modifiers are applied).\nThis number won&#8217;t often be used, but it can be handy sometimes,\nespecially if the creature has the Power Attack or Combat Expertise\nfeats.</p>\n    <p>The number after the slash is the creature&#8217;s grapple bonus,\nwhich is used when the creature makes a grapple attack or when someone\ntries to grapple the creature. The grapple bonus includes all modifiers\nthat apply to the creature&#8217;s grapple checks (base attack bonus,\nStrength modifier, special size modifier, and any other applicable\nmodifier, such as a racial bonus on grapple checks).</p>\n    <a id=\"attack\"></a><h6>Attack</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line shows the single attack the creature\nmakes with an attack action. In most cases, this is also the attack the\ncreature uses when making an attack of opportunity as well. The attack\nline provides the weapon used (natural or manufactured), attack bonus,\nand form of attack (melee or ranged). The attack bonus given includes\nmodifications for size and Strength (for melee attacks) or Dexterity\n(for ranged attacks). A creature with the Weapon Finesse feat can use\nits Dexterity modifier on melee attacks.</p>\n    <p>If the creature uses natural attacks, the natural weapon given\nhere is the creature&#8217;s primary natural weapon. If the creature has\nseveral different weapons at its disposal, the alternatives are shown,\nwith each different attack separated by the word &#8220;or.&#8221; </p>\n    <p>A creature can use one of its secondary natural weapons when\nmaking an attack action, but if it does it takes an attack penalty, as\nnoted in the Full Attack section below.</p>\n    <p>The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically.\nDamage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction\nfrom a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.</p>\n    <a id=\"full-attack\"></a><h6>Full Attack</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line shows all the physical attacks the\ncreature makes when it uses a full-round action to make a full attack.\nIt gives the number of attacks along with the weapon, attack bonus, and\nform of attack (melee or ranged). The first entry is for the creature&#8217;s\nprimary weapon, with an attack bonus including modifications for size\nand Strength (for melee attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A\ncreature with the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on\nmelee attacks. The remaining weapons are secondary, and attacks with\nthem are made with a &#8211;5 penalty to the attack roll, no matter how many\nthere are. Creatures with the Multiattack feat take only a &#8211;2 penalty\non secondary attacks. The damage that each attack deals is noted\nparenthetically. Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even\nif a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.</p>\n    <p>A creature&#8217;s primary attack damage includes its full Strength\nmodifier (1-1/2 times its Strength bonus if the attack is with the\ncreature&#8217;s sole natural weapon) and is given first. Secondary attacks\nadd only 1/2 the creature&#8217;s Strength bonus and are given second in the\nparentheses. </p>\n    <p>If any attacks also have some special effect other than\ndamage, that information is given here.</p>\n    <p>Unless noted otherwise, creatures using natural weapons deal\ndouble damage on critical hits.</p>\n    <p><b>Manufactured Weapons</b>: Creatures that use swords, bows,\nspears, and the like follow the same rules as characters do. The bonus\nfor attacks with two-handed weapons is 1-1/2 times the creature&#8217;s\nStrength modifier (if it is a bonus), and is given first. Offhand\nweapons add only 1/2 the Strength bonus and are given second in the\nparentheses.</p>\n    <a id=\"space-reach\"></a><h6>Space/Reach</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line describes how much space the\ncreature takes up on the battle grid and thereby needs to fight\neffectively, as well as how close it has to be to threaten an opponent.\nThe number before the slash is the creature&#8217;s space, or how many feet\none side of the creature occupies. The number after the slash is the\ncreature&#8217;s natural reach. If the creature has exceptional reach due to\na weapon, tentacle, or the like, the extended reach and its source are\nnoted in parentheses at the end of the line.</p>\n    <a id=\"special-attacks-and-special-qualities\"></a><h6>Special Attacks and Special Qualities</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Many creatures have unusual abilities. A\nmonster entry breaks these abilities into special attacks and special\nqualities. The latter category includes defenses, vulnerabilities, and\nother special abilities that are not modes of attack. A special ability\nis either extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su).\nAdditional information (when needed) is provided in the creature&#8217;s\ndescriptive text.</p>\n    <p>When a special ability allows a saving throw, the kind of save\nand the save DC is noted in the descriptive text. Most saving throws\nagainst special abilities have DCs calculated as follows: 10 + 1/2 the\nattacker&#8217;s racial Hit Dice + the relevant ability modifier. The save DC\nis given in the creature&#8217;s description along with the ability on which\nthe DC is based.</p>\n    <a id=\"saves\"></a><h6>Saves</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line gives the creature&#8217;s Fortitude,\nReflex, and Will save modifiers.</p>\n    <a id=\"abilities\"></a><h6>Abilities</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line lists the creature&#8217;s ability scores,\nin the customary order: Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. Except where\nnoted otherwise, each creature is assumed to have the standard array of\nability scores before racial adjustments (all 11s and 10s). To\ndetermine any creature&#8217;s racial ability adjustments, subtract 10 from\nany even-numbered ability score and subtract 11 from any odd-numbered\nscore. (Exceptions are noted in the Combat section of a creature&#8217;s\ndescriptive text.) </p>\n    <a id=\"strength\"></a><p><b>Strength</b>: Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than\nbipeds can. Any creature with four or more motive limbs can carry a\nload as a quadruped, even if it does not necessarily use all the limbs\nat once.</p>\n    <a id=\"intelligence\"></a><p><b>Intelligence</b>: A creature can speak all the languages\nmentioned in its description, plus one additional language per point of\nIntelligence bonus. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or\nhigher understands at least one language (Common, unless noted\notherwise).</p>\n    <a id=\"nonabilities\"></a><p><b>Nonabilities</b>: Some creatures lack certain ability\nscores. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0&#8212;they lack the\nability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. </p>\n    <a id=\"skills\"></a><h6>Skills</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line gives the creature&#8217;s skills, along\nwith each skill&#8217;s modifier (including adjustments for ability scores,\narmor check penalties, and any bonuses from feats or racial traits).\nAll listed skills are class skills, unless the creature has a character\nclass (noted in the entry). A creature&#8217;s type and Intelligence score\ndetermine the number of skill points it has.</p>\n    <p>The Skills section of the creature&#8217;s description recaps racial\nbonuses and other adjustments to skill modifiers for the sake of\nclarity; these bonuses should not be added to the listed skill\nmodifiers.</p>\n    <p>An asterisk (*) beside the relevant score and in the Skills\nsection of the descriptive text indicates a conditional adjustment, one\nthat applies only in certain situations.</p>\n    <a id=\"natural-tendencies\"></a><p><b>Natural Tendencies</b>: Some creatures simply aren&#8217;t made\nfor certain types of physical activity. If it seems clear that a\nparticular creature simply is not made for a particular physical\nactivity, that creature takes a &#8211;8 penalty on skill checks that defy\nits natural tendencies. In extreme circumstances the creature fails the\ncheck automatically.</p>\n    <a id=\"feats\"></a><h6>Feats</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The line gives the creature&#8217;s feats. A monster\ngains feats just as a character does. Sometimes a creature has one or\nmore bonus feats, marked with a superscript B (B). Creatures often do\nnot have the prerequisites for a bonus feat. If this is so, the\ncreature can still use the feat. If you wish to customize the creature\nwith new feats, you can reassign its other feats, but not its bonus\nfeats. A creature cannot have a feat that is not a bonus feat unless it\nhas the feat&#8217;s prerequisites.</p>\n    <a id=\"environment\"></a><h6>Environment</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line gives a type of climate and terrain\nwhere the creature is typically found. This describes a tendency, but\nis not exclusionary.</p>\n    <a id=\"organization\"></a><h6>Organization</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line describes the kinds of groups the\ncreature might form. A range of numbers in parentheses indicates how\nmany combat-ready adults are in each type of group. Many groups also\nhave a number of noncombatants, expressed as a percentage of the\nfighting population. Noncombatants can include young, the infirm,\nslaves, or other individuals who are not inclined to fight. If the\norganization line contains the term &#8220;domesticated,&#8221; the creature is\ngenerally found only in the company of other creatures, whom it serves\nin some capacity.</p>\n    <a id=\"challenge-rating\"></a><h6>Challenge Rating</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This shows the average level of a party of\nadventurers for which one creature would make an encounter of moderate\ndifficulty.</p>\n    <a id=\"treasure\"></a><h6>Treasure</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line reflects how much wealth the\ncreature owns. In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or\nlair and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures\nthat own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry\nand use these, leaving bulky items at home.</p>\n    <a id=\"alignment\"></a><h6>Alignment</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line gives the alignment that the\ncreature is most likely to have. Every entry includes a qualifier that\nindicates how broadly that alignment applies to the species as a whole.</p>\n    <a id=\"advancement\"></a><h6>Advancement</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The monster entry usually describes only the\nmost commonly encountered version of a creature. The advancement line\nshows how tough a creature can get, in terms of extra Hit Dice. (This\nis not an absolute limit, but exceptions are extremely rare.) Often,\nintelligent creatures advance by gaining a level in a character class\ninstead of just gaining a new Hit Die.</p>\n    <a id=\"level-adjustment\"></a><h6>Level Adjustment</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This line is included in the entries of\ncreatures suitable for use as player characters or as cohorts (usually\ncreatures with Intelligence scores of at least 3 and possessing\nopposable thumbs). Add this number to the creature&#8217;s total Hit Dice,\nincluding class levels, to get the creature&#8217;s effective character level\n(ECL). A character&#8217;s ECL affects the experience the character earns,\nthe amount of experience the character must have before gaining a new\nlevel, and the character&#8217;s starting equipment.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
