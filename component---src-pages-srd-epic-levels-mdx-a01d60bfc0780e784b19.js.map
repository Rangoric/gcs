The following guidelines describe how the epic class\nprogressions. \n    <ul>\n      <li>A character continues to gain Hit Dice and skill points as\nnormal beyond 20th level.</li>\n      <li>Generally, any class feature that uses class level as part\nof a\nmathematical formula continues to increase using the character&#8217;s class\nlevel in the formula.&nbsp; Any prestige class feature that calculates\na\nsave DC using the class level should add only half the character&#8217;s\nclass levels above 10th.</li>\n      <li>For spellcasters, caster level continues to increase after\n20th level.\nHowever, spells per day don&#8217;t increase after 20th level. The only way\nto gain additional spells per day (other than the bonus spells gained\nfrom a high ability score) is to select the Improved Spell Capacity\nepic feat.</li>\n      <li>The powers of familiars, special mounts, and fiendish\nservants continue to increase as their masters gain levels. </li>\n      <li>Any class features that increase or accumulate as part of a\nrepeated\npattern also continues to increase or accumulate after 20th level at\nthe same rate.&nbsp; An exception to this rule is any bonus feat\ngranted as\na class feature. If a character gets bonus feats as part of a class\nfeature, these do not increase with epic levels. Instead, these classes\nget bonus feats at a different rate (described in each epic class\ndescription).</li>\n      <li>In addition to the class features retained from nonepic\nlevels, each\nclass gains a bonus feat every two, three, four, or five levels after\n20th. This augments each class&#8217;s progression of class features, because\nnot all classes otherwise improve class features after 20th level. A\ncharacter must select these feats from the list of bonus feats for that\nclass. These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that every\ncharacter gets every three levels. The character isn&#8217;t limited to\nselecting from the class list when selecting these feats.</li>\n      <li>Characters don&#8217;t gain any new class features, because there\naren&#8217;t any\nnew class features described for these levels. Class features with a\nprogression that slows or stops before 20th level and features that\nhave a limited list of options do not improve as a character gains epic\nlevels. Likewise, class features that are gained only at a single level\ndo not improve.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Likewise, class features that are gained only at a single\nlevel do not improve.</p>\n    <a id=\"adding-a-second-class\"></a><h6>Adding a Second Class</h6>\nWhen a single-class epic character gains a level, he or she may choose\nto increase the level of his or her current class or pick up a new\nclass at 1st level. The standard rules for multiclass characters still\napply, but epic characters must keep in mind the rules for epic\nadvancement. The epic character gains all the 1st-level class skills,\nweapon proficiency, armor proficiency, spells, and other class features\nof the new class, as well as a Hit Die of the appropriate type. In\naddition, the character gets the usual skill points from the new class.\nJust as with standard multiclassing, adding the second class does not\nconfer some of the benefits for a 1st-level character, including\nmaximum hit points from the first Hit Die, quadruple the per-level\nskill points, starting equipment, starting gold, or an animal\ncompanion. An epic character does not gain the base attack bonuses and\nbase save bonuses normally gained when adding a second class. Instead,\nan epic character uses the epic attack bonus and epic save bonus\nprogression shown on Table: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonus. Whenever\nan epic character is allowed to pick up a feat as part of character\nlevel advancement, he or she can choose either a nonepic feat or an\nepic feat. All class descriptions provide a list of bonus feats that\ncharacters must choose from. When a character has to choose from a list\nof bonus feats in the second class, he or she can also choose from the\nbonus epic feats described for each specific class. \n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","id","border","cellPadding","cellSpacing","style","className","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
