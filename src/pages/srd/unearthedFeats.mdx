Weapons are divided into three categories in the basic d20 system rules:
simple, martial, and exotic. While this system works very well for
establishing the complexity of each weapon and balancing the classes'
abilities against one another, grouping weapons by similar type offers an
exciting variant to determine what weapons a character knows how to use.
<p>
At its simplest, the weapon group feat variant establishes a small list of
feats called Weapon Group proficiency feats. Each feat allows a character
to use a small number of similar weapons without penalty. Although most
characters using this system are proficient with fewer weapons than the standard character classes, the weapons they
know how to use will be grouped along a similar theme, providing a little
more flavor to each character's weapon choice at the expense of a small
amount of versatility.
</p>
<p>
This variant includes references to some weapons featured in the <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881590000">Arms and
Equipment Guide</a> (marked A) and <a style="color: #579eb6" href=

marked.

<h5><a id="using-weapon-groups-in-place-of-class-weapon-proficiencies"></a>
USING WEAPON GROUPS IN PLACE OF CLASS WEAPON PROFICIENCIES
</h5>
While the Weapon Group proficiency feats work well in conjunction with the
standard classes' starting armor and weapon proficiencies, you might want
to substitute a number of these feats for each class's starting weapon
proficiencies. Doing this can lend more flavor to specific characters or
organizations. It allows you (either as player or as game master) to
design a sect of clerics whose members always choose the same weapon group
proficiencies, or even establish racial preferences. All dwarf fighters,
rangers, and paladins might be required, for example, to choose <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#weapon-group-picks-and-hammers">Weapon
Group (picks and hammers)</a> as one of their starting weapon group
proficiencies.
<p>
For classes not listed here, assign starting weapon group proficiencies
using the class's granted weapon proficiencies and these classes as a
guide.

USING WEAPON GROUPS WITH RACIAL FAVORED WEAPONS
</h5>
Some races gain free weapon proficiencies or are innately familiar with
specific exotic weapons. Use the following rules to incorporate this
concept with the Weapon Group proficiency variant.
<p><b>Dwarf:</b> Any dwarf who has <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#weapon-group-axes">Weapon Group (axes)</a> is also proficient
with the dwarven waraxe and the dwarven urgrosh.
</p>
<p><b>Elf:</b>All elves automatically have <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#weapon-group-bows">Weapon Group (bows)</a> and either <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#weapon-group-heavy-blades">Weapon Group
(heavy blades)</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#weapon-group-light-blades">Weapon Group (light blades)</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Gnome:</b> Any gnome who has <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#weapon-group-picks-and-hammers">Weapon Group Proficiency (picks and hammers)</a> is also
proficient with the gnome hooked hammer.
</p>
<h5><a id="weapon-specific-feats"></a>
WEAPON-SPECIFIC FEATS
</h5>
A game master who uses this variant can rule that any feat that requires a
character to choose a specific weapon to apply the feat's benefit to (such
as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#improved-critical">Improved Critical</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#weapon-specialization">Weapon Specialization</a>) can instead
be applied to a weapon group. The character must still meet the
prerequisites for the feat.
<p>
Though this variant seems to grant a large benefit to the character, it
really doesn't significantly improve the character's power level. Since a
typical character only wields one weapon at a time (or two, with a
different weapon in each hand), the character doesn't really become any
more powerful in a typical fight.
</p>
<p>
It does mean that a character is more likely to benefit when new magic
weapons are found, since he's more likely to be skilled in their use. That
can actually be beneficial to a campaign, in that it allows the game
master to include a wider range of interesting treasures that the
characters actually use (rather than simply sell or trade).
</p>
<h5><a id="crating-new-weapon-groups"></a>
CREATING NEW WEAPON GROUPS
</h5>
As you design a campaign or character, you might want to create new weapon
groups based on different themes. Possible themes include cultural,
racial, or other campaign-world specific ideas. For example, you might
create a new weapon group proficiency feat called Weapon Group (hill
dwarves) that is available only to dwarves from a specific geographical
area of the campaign. Because these dwarves are known for their use of two
light weapons at once, this feat grants proficiency in the handaxe, short
sword, light hammer, and club, making it easier for these dwarves to learn
their race's preferred fighting techniques.
<p>
When creating a new weapon group, you should limit each group to three or
fewer simple weapons and one to three martial weapons. The Weapon Group
proficiency feats described below provide examples of how much versatility
each weapon group should provide a character.
