<h5>CLIMB (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: With a successful Climb check,
you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other
steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your
normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle
measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle
measuring 60 degrees or more.</p>
<p>A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no
progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from
whatever height you have already attained.</p>
<p>A climber&#8217;s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb
checks.</p>
<p>The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb.
Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an
appropriate DC.</p>

<p>You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall
with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that
requires only one hand. While climbing, you can&#8217;t move to avoid a blow,
so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can&#8217;t use a
shield while climbing.</p>
<p>Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check
against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your
current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.</p>
<p><i>Accelerated Climbing</i>: You try to climb more quickly
than normal. By accepting a &#8211;5 penalty, you can move half your speed
(instead of one-quarter your speed).</p>
<p><i>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds</i>: You can make
your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing
so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of
distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a
wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with
a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.</p>
<p><i>Catching Yourself When Falling</i>: It&#8217;s practically
impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb
check (DC = wall&#8217;s DC + 20) to do so. It&#8217;s much easier to catch
yourself on a slope (DC = slope&#8217;s DC + 10).</p>
<p><i>Catching a Falling Character While Climbing</i>: If someone
climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch
the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so
requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character
(though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if
desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC =
wall&#8217;s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling
character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot
exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail
your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character&#8217;s fall
but don&#8217;t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you
fail to stop the character&#8217;s fall and begin falling as well.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Climbing is part of movement, so it&#8217;s generally
part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement
in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires
a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character
doesn&#8217;t take an action.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: You can use a rope to haul a character upward
(or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your
maximum load in this manner.</p>
<p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because
halflings are agile and surefooted.</p>
<p>The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb
checks.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#athletic"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Athletic</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p>A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all
Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or
slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10,
even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb
speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its
climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a
single Climb check at a &#8211;5 penalty. Such a creature retains its
Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents
get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however,
use the run action while climbing.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a
href="skillsAll.html#use-rope" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Use
Rope</a>, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a
knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p>
<h5>JUMP (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: The DC and the distance you can
cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).</p>
<p>Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30
feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your
speed is less than 30 feet, you take a &#8211;6 penalty for every 10 feet of
speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you
gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.</p>
<p>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start,
which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before
attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the
jump is doubled.</p>
<p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal
maximum movement in a round.</p>
<p>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you
land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check
untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.</p>
<p><i>Long Jump</i>: A long jump is a horizontal jump, made
across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you
attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal
distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).</p>
<p>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end.
If you fail the check by less than 5, you don&#8217;t clear the distance, but
you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You
end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling
over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15
Climb check.</p>

</table>
<p><i>High Jump</i>: A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach
a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4
times the distance to be cleared.</p>
<p>If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check
indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull
yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.
If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land
on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long
jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least
20 feet.</p>

<p>Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies
according to the size of the character or creature. The maximum
vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an
average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a
Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)
Quadrupedal creatures don&#8217;t have the same vertical reach as a bipedal
creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.</p>

</table>
<p><i>Hop Up</i>: You can jump up onto an object as tall as your
waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing
so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you
could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get
a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a
running start.</p>
<p><i>Jumping Down</i>: If you intentionally jump from a height,
you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump
down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to
jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p>
<p>If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you
had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: None. A Jump check is included in your
movement, so it is part of a move action. If you run out of movement
mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on
your next turn) must be a move action to complete the jump.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: Effects that increase your movement also
increase your jumping distance, since your check is modified by your
speed.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#run"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Run</a> feat, you get a +4 bonus on
Jump checks for any jumps made after a running start.</p>
<p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because
halflings are agile and athletic.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#acrobatic"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Acrobatic</a> feat, you get a +2

you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on
Tumble checks.</p>
<h5>SWIM (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: Make a Swim check once per round
while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to
one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your
speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no
progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.</p>
<p>If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check
or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold
your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to
your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take
move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a
full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the
duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round.
(Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only
half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC
10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each
round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the
Constitution check, you begin to drown.</p>
<p>The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on
the table below.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or
take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: A successful Swim check allows you to swim
one-quarter of your speed as a move action or one-half your speed as a
full-round action.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: Swim checks are subject to double the normal
armor check penalty and encumbrance penalty.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#athletic"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Athletic</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Swim checks.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#endurance"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Endurance</a> feat, you get a +4
bonus on Swim checks made to avoid taking nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>
<p>A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its
indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus
on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The
creature always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if
distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run
action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.</p>
