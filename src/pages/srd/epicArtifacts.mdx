Just like nonepic magic items, epic magic items sometimes possess
intelligence of their own. Such items are fully sentient and should be
treated as NPCs. The Random Epic Magic Items section details the
chances that epic armor, shields, rings, rods, staffs, wondrous items,
and weapons might be intelligent. In short, a ring, rod, staff,
wondrous item, armor, or shield has a 1% chance to be intelligent, a
ranged weapon has a 5% chance to be intelligent, and a melee weapon has
a 15% chance to be intelligent. Rather than using the tables for
nonepic items, use the tables below to determine the properties of an
intelligent item: the number of powers, unusual properties, alignment,
and special purpose of the item (if any). Of the three mental ability
scores, two scores are favored (2d6 + some number) and one is
completely random (3d6). Choose which scores get assigned which number,
or roll 1d4 and determine randomly according to the following table.

The first step in determining the properties of a random intelligent
epic magic item is to determine its general capabilities. These are
found by rolling d% and consulting Table: Epic Items Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities.

<a id="market-price-modifier"></a><h5>MARKET PRICE MODIFIER </h5>
To find the market price for an epic magic item, use these expanded
guidelines, adjusting as necessary to find an appropriate final price.
Each point of Intelligence bonus, Wisdom bonus, or Charisma bonus
increases the item&#8217;s market price by 400 gp. Any form of communication
possessed by the item increases its market price by the number shown on
Table: Epic Item Communication. Each primary ability possessed by the
item increases its market price by 2,000 to 10,000 gp (average 6,000
gp). Each extraordinary ability possessed by the item increases its
market price by 15,000 to 35,000 gp (average 25,000 gp). A special
purpose increases the item&#8217;s market price by 50,000 gp. An awesome
power increases the item&#8217;s market price by 100,000 gp. 

<a id="intelligent-item-alignment"></a><h5>INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT </h5>
Any item with Intelligence has an alignment. Make sure that the
alignment choosen or determine randomly (using Table: Item Alignment)
matches any alignment-oriented special abilities of the item. Any
character whose alignment is not compatible with that of the item gains
one negative level for every 10 points of the weapon&#8217;s Ego (see Item
Ego, below) if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this
never results in actual level loss, the negative levels remain as long
as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including
restoration spells). These negative levels are cumulative with any
other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders.

<a id="item-communication"></a><h5>ITEM COMMUNICATION </h5>
Like a character, an intelligent item speaks Common plus one language
per point of Intelligence bonus. Choose appropriate languages, taking
into account the item&#8217;s origin and purposes. An item with multiple
modes of communication can use any of its modes at will.

<p>If the same ability is rolled twice or more, the range,
frequency, or effectiveness of the power is doubled, tripled, and so
on. All abilities function only when the item is held, drawn, or
otherwise brandished and the possessor is concentrating on the desired
result. Activating a power is a standard action, but using a free feat
is not. Feats may be used regardless of prerequisites, but the item
still must be held and drawn (or worn, in the case of such items). An
intelligent item might activate a power on its own.

Unless otherwise stated, all awesome powers function at 20th caster
level. If a power is rolled twice, the uses per day are doubled. Powers
function only when the item is drawn and held, and the possessor is
concentrating upon the desired effect. Activating a power is a standard
action. An intelligent item might activate a power on its own.

A special purpose power operates only when the item is in pursuit of
its special purpose. This is always up to the purview of the item. It
should always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends justify
the means. That is to say that if the player&#8217;s reasoning for how a
particular action serves the item&#8217;s purpose is not completely
believable, the item won&#8217;t allow it.

<a id="items-against-characters"></a><h5>ITEMS AGAINST CHARACTERS </h5>
<p>When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own.
The item is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the
character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment&#8217;s goals
or the item&#8217;s special purpose, personality conflict-item against
character-results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or
higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a
personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree
with the item. When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must
make a Will saving throw (DC = item&#8217;s Ego). If the possessor succeeds,
he or she is dominant. If he or she fails, the item is dominant.
Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such
as a major battle, a serious threat to either item or character, and so
on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character&#8217;s desires
and demands concessions such as any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or
personality is distasteful to the item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character divesting him or herself of all other magic
items or items of a certain type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where
they go for its own purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to
the item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magical protections and devices to protect the item from
molestation when it is not in use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the character carry the item with him or her on all
occasions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more
suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher
measures. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Force its possessor into combat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refuse to strike opponents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strike at its wielder or his or her associates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cause itself to drop from the character&#8217;s grasp. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns
between the character&#8217;s and item&#8217;s alignments or when their purposes
and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have
a lesser character possess it in order to easily command him or her, or
a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals. All
magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in
whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are
rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No
intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent
item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60
feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract
their host so that he or she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course,
alignment might change this sort of behavior. </p>
<p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or
silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never
successfully control their possessor. They may be powerless to force
their demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and
demands. </p>

<p>No character can gain any effect from an additional roll of
the dice within 24 hours, with two exceptions. If a 2 is rolled, the
dice automatically roll themselves at the beginning of the character&#8217;s
next turn and he or she must accept the additional result. If a 12 is
rolled, the character may choose to roll again in the next round (if
more than 1 full round elapses between the roll of 12 and this bonus
roll, the character loses the bonus roll). There is no method (mundane
or magical) to predict or influence the result of a roll of Rogue&#8217;s
dice. Even powerful divination magic can&#8217;t predict the outcome of a
roll before it is made.

<a id="axe-of-the-dwarvish-lords"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Axe of the Dwarvish Lords:</span>
This is a +6 keen throwing goblinoid bane dwarven waraxe. Any dwarf who
holds it doubles the range of his or her darkvision. Any nondwarf who
grasps the Axe takes 2 points of temporary Charisma damage; these
points cannot be healed or restored in any way while the Axe is held.
The current owner of the Axe gains a +10 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing,
blacksmithing, gemcutting, stonemasonry, and weaponsmithing) checks.
The wielder of the Axe can summon an elder earth elemental (as summon
monster IX; duration 20 rounds) once per week. </p>
<a id="codex-of-the-infinite-planes"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Codex of the Infinite Planes:</span>
The Codex is enormous-supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift
it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone
opening the Codex for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a
destruction spell (Fortitude DC 30 for only 10d6 damage). Those who
survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without
risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a
Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power
learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per
additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each
day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per
day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the insanity spell). The
powers of the Codex of the Infinite Planes are as follows: astral
projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally,
greater planar binding, plane shift, and soul bind. Each is usable at
will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how
to access the power). The Codex of the Infinite Planes has a caster
level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all
saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires
both a Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the
spell level of the power; the character can&#8217;t take 10 on this check).
Any failure on either check indicates a catastrophe befalls the user
(roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur
one catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails both checks.

<a id="cup-and-talisman-of-the-demigod"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cup and Talisman of the
Demigod:</span> The Cup is a large gem-set golden chalice requiring two
hands to lift. It emits light (as the daylight spell) at all times and
automatically dispels any darkness-based spells whose area it enters.
If the cup is filled with holy water (requiring a full gallon), that
substance will act as a potion of cure critical wounds or a potion of
neutralize poison (owner&#8217;s choice) if drunk. This liquid can&#8217;t be saved
or stored in any way. The Talisman is a small eight-pointed platinum
star hanging from a chain of gold and pearls. The wearer gains a +6
enhancement bonus to Charisma and may cast remove blindness/deafness,
remove curse, and remove disease at will. Furthermore, if the Talisman
is placed within the Cup and the Cup filled with holy water, that
liquid acts as a special elixir of resurrection (as the spell). This
effect will function only once per month. Any evil or chaotic creature
that touches the Cup or Talisman is struck with a holy word (if evil)
or dictum (if chaotic) spell (or both if the creature is chaotic evil).
</p>
<a id="eye-of-the-orc"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eye of the Orc:</span> This
lump of rock has a marquis-cut black sapphire set in its center, making
it appear similar to a large eye. If possessed by an orc, it grants a
+6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma, and the orc&#8217;s darkvision
range is doubled. Nonorcs who possess the Eye gain a +2 enhancement
bonus to Strength but take a -2 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma.
Regardless of the owner&#8217;s race, any weapon wielded by the owner of the
Eye is considered an elf bane weapon. Furthermore, by holding the Eye
before the character, he or she can perceive things as if he or she had
true seeing cast upon him or her. This can be activated only once per
day but lasts as long as the character concentrates on it (requiring a
standard action each round). </p>
<a id="golem-armor"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Golem Armor:</span> This
enormous suit of black iron +10 full plate armor increases the wearer&#8217;s
size by one category (to a maximum of Colossal). The wearer gains a +10
enhancement bonus to Strength and is rendered immune to mind-affecting
effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. He or she is not subject
to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or
death from massive damage. Golem Armor is immune to rust attacks. The
wearer of Golem Armor gains damage reduction 15/adamantine. He or she
also cannot regain hit points by any means (mundane or magical) while
the armor is worn. It requires 1 hour to don or extract oneself from
Golem Armor. </p>
<a id="invulnerable-coat"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invulnerable Coat:</span> The
Invulnerable Coat +5 chain shirt of heavy fortification. It grants its
wearer damage reduction 10/epic and resistance 20 against acid, cold,
electricity, fire, and sonic energy. If the wearer can turn undead,
treat the wearer as having +4 class levels for purposes of caster
level, turning undead, smiting evil, and laying on hands. </p>
<a id="iron-gauntlet-of-war"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Iron Gauntlet of War:</span>
The Gauntlet grants a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength. The wearer
doubles the damage bonus on any smite attacks he or she makes. If the
wearer has the Leadership feat, the wearer&#8217;s Leadership score increases
by +4, but the wearer can never attract or keep followers or cohorts
who are good or chaotic. Once per day, the wielder can use implosion as
a 20th-level caster (DC 23). The Iron Gauntlet of War is intelligent
(Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 24, Ego 26) and lawful evil. It can communicate
telepathically with its wearer, though it cannot speak. It will always
seek to dominate any wearer who isn&#8217;t lawful evil, forcing such an
owner to commit lawful evil deeds (or else find a more suitable
wearer). </p>
<a id="ring-of-nine-facets"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ring of Nine Facets:</span>
This ring is set with a gem of nine facets, each one in-scribed with a
different incomprehensible rune. Each day at sunrise, the gem turns to
display a different facet. The active facet determines the Ring&#8217;s power
for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 to determine which facet (and thus
which power) is active.

<p>The wearer of the Ring can, with a great deal of mental
exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one he or she
does not desire. This requires a full-round action and a Concentration
check (DC 50), and deals 2d6 points of nonlethal damage regardless of
success. If the save is successful, the new facet is determined
randomly. If the Ring is removed, the former wearer takes 2d6 points of
nonlethal damage each minute until it is replaced or until his or her
nonlethal damage exceeds his or her current hit points (though the
nonlethal damage resumes again immediately when the former wearer
regains consciousness).
