<a id="initiative-checks"></a><p class="initial"><b>Initiative Checks</b>: At the start of a
battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An initiative check
is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her Dexterity
modifier to the roll. Characters act in order, counting down from
highest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters
act in the same order (unless a character takes an action that results
in his or her initiative changing; see Special Initiative Actions). If
two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the
combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier
(highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should
roll again to determine which one of them goes before the other.</p>
<a id="flat-footed"></a><p><b>Flat-Footed</b>: At the start of a battle, before you have
had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn in
the initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can&#8217;t use your
Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues
have the uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which allows them to
avoid losing their Dexterity bonus to AC due to being flat-footed. A
flat-footed character can&#8217;t make attacks of opportunity.</p>
<a id="inaction"></a><p><b>Inaction</b>: Even if you can&#8217;t take actions, you retain
your initiative score for the duration of the encounter.</p>
<a id="surprise"></a><h5>SURPRISE</h5>
<p class="initial">When a combat starts, if you are not aware of
your opponents and they are aware of you, you&#8217;re surprised.</p>
<a id="determining-awareness"></a><h6>Determining Awareness</h6>
<p class="initial">Sometimes all the combatants on a side are
aware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some
of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the
other combatants on each side are unaware.</p>
<p>Determining awareness may call for Listen checks, Spot checks,
or other checks.</p>
<a id="the-surprise-round"></a><p><b>The Surprise Round</b>: If some but not all of the
combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens
before regular rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the opponents can
act in the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In initiative
order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of
their opponents each take a standard action during the surprise round.
You can also take free actions during the surprise round. If no one or
everyone is surprised, no surprise round occurs.</p>
<a id="unaware-combatants"></a><p><b>Unaware Combatants</b>: Combatants who are unaware at the
start of battle don&#8217;t get to act in the surprise round. Unaware
combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted yet, so they
lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>

<p class="initial">Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her
guard down. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her
lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called
attacks of opportunity.</p>
<a id="threatened-squares"></a><p><b>Threatened Squares</b>: You threaten all squares into which
you can make a melee attack, even when it is not your action.
Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space
(including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a
threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you&#8217;re
unarmed, you don&#8217;t normally threaten any squares and thus can&#8217;t make
attacks of opportunity.</p>
<a id="reach-weapons"></a><p><i>Reach Weapons</i>: Most creatures of Medium or smaller size
have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee
attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However,
Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more squares
than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium
have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.</p>
<a id="provoking-and-attack-of-opportunity"></a><p><b>Provoking an Attack of Opportunity</b>: Two kinds of
actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened
square and performing an action within a threatened square.</p>
<a id="moving"></a><p><i>Moving</i>: Moving out of a threatened square usually
provokes an attack of opportunity from the threatening opponent. There
are two common methods of avoiding such an attack&#8212;the <a href="actionsInCombat.html#step-5-ft">5-foot-step</a> and
the <a href="actionsInCombat.html#withdraw">withdraw</a> action.</p>
<a id="performing-a-distracting-act"></a><p><i>Performing a Distracting Act</i>: Some actions, when
performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity as you
divert your attention from the battle. Table: Actions in Combat notes
many of the actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Remember that even actions that normally provoke attacks of
opportunity may have exceptions to this rule.</p>
<a id="making-an-attack-of-opportunity"></a><p><b>Making an Attack of Opportunity</b>: An attack of
opportunity is a single melee attack, and you can only make one per
round. You don&#8217;t have to make an attack of opportunity if you don&#8217;t
want to.</p>
<p>An experienced character gets additional regular melee attacks
(by using the full attack action), but at a lower attack bonus. You
make your attack of opportunity, however, at your normal attack
bonus&#8212;even if you&#8217;ve already attacked in the round.</p>
<p>An attack of opportunity &#8220;interrupts&#8221; the normal flow of
actions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked,
immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the
next character&#8217;s turn (or complete the current turn, if the attack of
opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character&#8217;s turn).</p>
<a id="combat-reflexes-and-additional-attacks-of-opportunity"></a><p><i>Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity</i>:
If you have the Combat Reflexes feat you can add your Dexterity
modifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a
round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given
opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of
opportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of
opportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving
out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same
round doesn&#8217;t count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All
these attacks are at your full normal attack bonus.</p>
