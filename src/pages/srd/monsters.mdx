<p class="initial">Each monster description is organized in the
same general format, as outlined below. </p>
<a id="statistics-block"></a><h5>STATISTICS BLOCK</h5>
<p class="initial">This portion of a monster description contains
basic game information on the creature.</p>
<a id="monster-name"></a><h6>Name</h6>
<p class="initial">This is the name by which the creature is
generally known. The descriptive text may provide other names.</p>
<a id="size-and-type"></a><h6>Size and Type</h6>
<p class="initial">This line describes the creature&#8217;s size. A
size modifier applies to the creature&#8217;s Armor Class (AC) and attack
bonus, as well as to certain skills. A creature&#8217;s size also determines
how far it can reach to make a melee attack and how much space it
occupies in a fight (see Space/Reach, below). </p>
<p>The size and type line continues with the creature&#8217;s type.
Type determines how magic affects a creature. Type determines certain
features, such as Hit Dice size, base attack bonus, base saving throw
bonuses, and skill points. </p>
<a id="hit-dice"></a><h6>Hit Dice</h6>
<p class="initial">This line gives the creature&#8217;s number and type
of Hit Dice, and lists any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives
the average hit points for a creature of the indicated number of Hit
Dice. A creature&#8217;s Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for
determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural
healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.</p>
<a id="initiative"></a><h6>Initiative</h6>
<p class="initial">This line gives the creature&#8217;s modifier on
initiative checks.</p>
<a id="speed"></a><h6>Speed</h6>
<p class="initial">This line gives the creature&#8217;s tactical speed
on land (the amount of distance it can cover in one move action). If
the creature wears armor that reduces its speed, the creature&#8217;s base
land speed follows.</p>
<p>If the creature has other modes of movement, these are given
after (or in place of) the land speed. Unless noted otherwise, modes of
movement are natural (not magical).</p>
<a id="armor-class"></a><h6>Armor Class</h6>
<p class="initial">The Armor Class line gives the creature&#8217;s AC
for normal combat and includes a parenthetical mention of the modifiers
contributing to it (usually size, Dexterity, and natural armor). The
creature&#8217;s touch and flat-footed ACs follow the combat-ready AC.</p>
<p>A creature&#8217;s armor proficiencies (if it has any) depend on its
type, but in general a creature is automatically proficient with any
kind of armor it is described as wearing (light, medium, or heavy), and
with all lighter kinds of armor.</p>
<a id="base-attack-grapple"></a><h6>Base Attack/Grapple</h6>
<p class="initial">The number before the slash on this line is
the creature&#8217;s base attack bonus (before any modifiers are applied).
This number won&#8217;t often be used, but it can be handy sometimes,
especially if the creature has the Power Attack or Combat Expertise
feats.</p>
<p>The number after the slash is the creature&#8217;s grapple bonus,
which is used when the creature makes a grapple attack or when someone
tries to grapple the creature. The grapple bonus includes all modifiers
that apply to the creature&#8217;s grapple checks (base attack bonus,
Strength modifier, special size modifier, and any other applicable
modifier, such as a racial bonus on grapple checks).</p>
<a id="attack"></a><h6>Attack</h6>
<p class="initial">This line shows the single attack the creature
makes with an attack action. In most cases, this is also the attack the
creature uses when making an attack of opportunity as well. The attack
line provides the weapon used (natural or manufactured), attack bonus,
and form of attack (melee or ranged). The attack bonus given includes
modifications for size and Strength (for melee attacks) or Dexterity
(for ranged attacks). A creature with the Weapon Finesse feat can use
its Dexterity modifier on melee attacks.</p>
<p>If the creature uses natural attacks, the natural weapon given
here is the creature&#8217;s primary natural weapon. If the creature has
several different weapons at its disposal, the alternatives are shown,
with each different attack separated by the word &#8220;or.&#8221; </p>
<p>A creature can use one of its secondary natural weapons when
making an attack action, but if it does it takes an attack penalty, as
noted in the Full Attack section below.</p>
<p>The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically.
Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction
from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.</p>
<a id="full-attack"></a><h6>Full Attack</h6>
<p class="initial">This line shows all the physical attacks the
creature makes when it uses a full-round action to make a full attack.
It gives the number of attacks along with the weapon, attack bonus, and
form of attack (melee or ranged). The first entry is for the creature&#8217;s
primary weapon, with an attack bonus including modifications for size
and Strength (for melee attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A
creature with the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on
melee attacks. The remaining weapons are secondary, and attacks with
them are made with a &#8211;5 penalty to the attack roll, no matter how many
there are. Creatures with the Multiattack feat take only a &#8211;2 penalty
on secondary attacks. The damage that each attack deals is noted
parenthetically. Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even
if a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.</p>
<p>A creature&#8217;s primary attack damage includes its full Strength
modifier (1-1/2 times its Strength bonus if the attack is with the
creature&#8217;s sole natural weapon) and is given first. Secondary attacks
add only 1/2 the creature&#8217;s Strength bonus and are given second in the
parentheses. </p>
<p>If any attacks also have some special effect other than
damage, that information is given here.</p>
<p>Unless noted otherwise, creatures using natural weapons deal
double damage on critical hits.</p>
<p><b>Manufactured Weapons</b>: Creatures that use swords, bows,
spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters do. The bonus
for attacks with two-handed weapons is 1-1/2 times the creature&#8217;s
Strength modifier (if it is a bonus), and is given first. Offhand
weapons add only 1/2 the Strength bonus and are given second in the
parentheses.</p>
<a id="space-reach"></a><h6>Space/Reach</h6>
<p class="initial">This line describes how much space the
creature takes up on the battle grid and thereby needs to fight
effectively, as well as how close it has to be to threaten an opponent.
The number before the slash is the creature&#8217;s space, or how many feet
one side of the creature occupies. The number after the slash is the
creature&#8217;s natural reach. If the creature has exceptional reach due to
a weapon, tentacle, or the like, the extended reach and its source are
noted in parentheses at the end of the line.</p>
<a id="special-attacks-and-special-qualities"></a><h6>Special Attacks and Special Qualities</h6>
<p class="initial">Many creatures have unusual abilities. A
monster entry breaks these abilities into special attacks and special
qualities. The latter category includes defenses, vulnerabilities, and
other special abilities that are not modes of attack. A special ability
is either extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su).
Additional information (when needed) is provided in the creature&#8217;s
descriptive text.</p>
<p>When a special ability allows a saving throw, the kind of save
and the save DC is noted in the descriptive text. Most saving throws
against special abilities have DCs calculated as follows: 10 + 1/2 the
attacker&#8217;s racial Hit Dice + the relevant ability modifier. The save DC
is given in the creature&#8217;s description along with the ability on which
the DC is based.</p>
<a id="saves"></a><h6>Saves</h6>
<p class="initial">This line gives the creature&#8217;s Fortitude,
Reflex, and Will save modifiers.</p>
<a id="abilities"></a><h6>Abilities</h6>
<p class="initial">This line lists the creature&#8217;s ability scores,
in the customary order: Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. Except where
noted otherwise, each creature is assumed to have the standard array of
ability scores before racial adjustments (all 11s and 10s). To
determine any creature&#8217;s racial ability adjustments, subtract 10 from
any even-numbered ability score and subtract 11 from any odd-numbered
score. (Exceptions are noted in the Combat section of a creature&#8217;s
descriptive text.) </p>
<a id="strength"></a><p><b>Strength</b>: Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than
bipeds can. Any creature with four or more motive limbs can carry a
load as a quadruped, even if it does not necessarily use all the limbs
at once.</p>
<a id="intelligence"></a><p><b>Intelligence</b>: A creature can speak all the languages
mentioned in its description, plus one additional language per point of
Intelligence bonus. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or
higher understands at least one language (Common, unless noted
otherwise).</p>
<a id="nonabilities"></a><p><b>Nonabilities</b>: Some creatures lack certain ability
scores. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0&#8212;they lack the
ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. </p>
<a id="skills"></a><h6>Skills</h6>
<p class="initial">This line gives the creature&#8217;s skills, along
with each skill&#8217;s modifier (including adjustments for ability scores,
armor check penalties, and any bonuses from feats or racial traits).
All listed skills are class skills, unless the creature has a character
class (noted in the entry). A creature&#8217;s type and Intelligence score
determine the number of skill points it has.</p>
<p>The Skills section of the creature&#8217;s description recaps racial
bonuses and other adjustments to skill modifiers for the sake of
clarity; these bonuses should not be added to the listed skill
modifiers.</p>
<p>An asterisk (*) beside the relevant score and in the Skills
section of the descriptive text indicates a conditional adjustment, one
that applies only in certain situations.</p>
<a id="natural-tendencies"></a><p><b>Natural Tendencies</b>: Some creatures simply aren&#8217;t made
for certain types of physical activity. If it seems clear that a
particular creature simply is not made for a particular physical
activity, that creature takes a &#8211;8 penalty on skill checks that defy
its natural tendencies. In extreme circumstances the creature fails the
check automatically.</p>
<a id="feats"></a><h6>Feats</h6>
<p class="initial">The line gives the creature&#8217;s feats. A monster
gains feats just as a character does. Sometimes a creature has one or
more bonus feats, marked with a superscript B (B). Creatures often do
not have the prerequisites for a bonus feat. If this is so, the
creature can still use the feat. If you wish to customize the creature
with new feats, you can reassign its other feats, but not its bonus
feats. A creature cannot have a feat that is not a bonus feat unless it
has the feat&#8217;s prerequisites.</p>
<a id="environment"></a><h6>Environment</h6>
<p class="initial">This line gives a type of climate and terrain
where the creature is typically found. This describes a tendency, but
is not exclusionary.</p>
<a id="organization"></a><h6>Organization</h6>
<p class="initial">This line describes the kinds of groups the
creature might form. A range of numbers in parentheses indicates how
many combat-ready adults are in each type of group. Many groups also
have a number of noncombatants, expressed as a percentage of the
fighting population. Noncombatants can include young, the infirm,
slaves, or other individuals who are not inclined to fight. If the
organization line contains the term &#8220;domesticated,&#8221; the creature is
generally found only in the company of other creatures, whom it serves
in some capacity.</p>
<a id="challenge-rating"></a><h6>Challenge Rating</h6>
<p class="initial">This shows the average level of a party of
adventurers for which one creature would make an encounter of moderate
difficulty.</p>
<a id="treasure"></a><h6>Treasure</h6>
<p class="initial">This line reflects how much wealth the
creature owns. In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or
lair and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures
that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry
and use these, leaving bulky items at home.</p>
<a id="alignment"></a><h6>Alignment</h6>
<p class="initial">This line gives the alignment that the
creature is most likely to have. Every entry includes a qualifier that
indicates how broadly that alignment applies to the species as a whole.</p>
<a id="advancement"></a><h6>Advancement</h6>
<p class="initial">The monster entry usually describes only the
most commonly encountered version of a creature. The advancement line
shows how tough a creature can get, in terms of extra Hit Dice. (This
is not an absolute limit, but exceptions are extremely rare.) Often,
intelligent creatures advance by gaining a level in a character class
instead of just gaining a new Hit Die.</p>
<a id="level-adjustment"></a><h6>Level Adjustment</h6>
<p class="initial">This line is included in the entries of
creatures suitable for use as player characters or as cohorts (usually
creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 3 and possessing
opposable thumbs). Add this number to the creature&#8217;s total Hit Dice,
including class levels, to get the creature&#8217;s effective character level
(ECL). A character&#8217;s ECL affects the experience the character earns,
the amount of experience the character must have before gaining a new
level, and the character&#8217;s starting equipment.</p>
