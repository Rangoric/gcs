<h2><a id="alignment-and-description"></a>Alignment &amp; Description</h2>


<h3><a id="alignment"></a>ALIGNMENT</h3>


<p class="initial">A creature&rsquo;s general moral and personal
attitudes are represented by its alignment: lawful good, neutral good,
chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil,
neutral evil, or chaotic evil.</p><p>


Alignment is a tool for developing your character&rsquo;s identity.
It is not a straitjacket for restricting your character. Each alignment
represents a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies,
so two characters of the same alignment can still be quite different
from each other. In addition, few people are completely consistent.</p>


<h5><a id="good-vs-evil"></a>GOOD VS. EVIL</h5>


<p class="initial">Good characters and creatures protect innocent
life. Evil characters and creatures debase or destroy innocent life,
whether for fun or profit.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Good&rdquo; implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for
the dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal
sacrifices to help others.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Evil&rdquo; implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some
evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without
qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing
for sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master. </p>


<p>People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have
compunctions against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to
make sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed
to others by personal relationships. </p>


<p>Being good or evil can be a conscious choice. For most people,
though, being good or evil is an attitude that one recognizes but does
not choose. Being neutral on the good&ndash;evil axis usually represents a
lack of commitment one way or the other, but for some it represents a
positive commitment to a balanced view. While acknowledging that good
and evil are objective states, not just opinions, these folk maintain
that a balance between the two is the proper place for people, or at
least for them.</p>


<p>Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are
neutral rather than good or evil. Even deadly vipers and tigers that
eat people are neutral because they lack the capacity for morally right
or wrong behavior.</p>


<h5><a id="law-vs-chaos"></a>LAW VS. CHAOS</h5>


<p class="initial">Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their
word, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall
short of their duties. Chaotic characters follow their consciences,
resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do
what they promise if they feel like it.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Law&rdquo; implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority,
and reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include
close-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, judgmentalness,
and a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness
say that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can
depend on each other and make the right decisions in full confidence
that others will act as they should.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Chaos&rdquo; implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the
downside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate
authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote
chaotic behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows
people to express themselves fully and lets society benefit from the
potential that its individuals have within them.</p>


<p>Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a
normal respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor
a compulsion to rebel. She is honest but can be tempted into lying or
deceiving others.</p>


<p>Devotion to law or chaos may be a conscious choice, but more
often it is a personality trait that is recognized rather than being
chosen. Neutrality on the lawful&ndash;chaotic axis is usually simply a
middle state, a state of not feeling compelled toward one side or the
other. Some few such neutrals, however, espouse neutrality as superior
to law or chaos, regarding each as an extreme with its own blind spots
and drawbacks.</p>


<p>Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are
neutral. Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited, but they do not
have the moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.</p>


<h5><a id="the-nine-alignments"></a>THE NINE ALIGNMENTS</h5>


<p class="initial">Nine distinct alignments define all the
possible combinations of the lawful&ndash;chaotic axis with the good&ndash;evil
axis. Each alignment description below depicts a typical character of
that alignment. Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that
a given character may act more or less in accord with his or her
alignment from day to day. Use these descriptions as guidelines, not as
scripts.</p>


<p>The first six alignments, lawful good through chaotic neutral,
are the standard alignments for player characters. The three evil
alignments are for monsters and villains.</p>


<p><a id="lawful-good"></a><a id="crusader"></a><b>Lawful Good, &ldquo;Crusader&rdquo;</b>: A lawful good character acts
as a good person is expected or required to act. She combines a
commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly.
She tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks
out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty
go unpunished.</p>


<p>Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it
combines honor and compassion.</p>


<p><a id="neutral-good"></a><a id="benefactor"></a><b>Neutral Good, &ldquo;Benefactor&rdquo;</b>: A neutral good character
does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping
others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden
to them.</p>


<p>Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means
doing what is good without bias for or against order.</p>


<p><a id="chaotic-good"></a><a id="rebel"></a><b>Chaotic Good, &ldquo;Rebel&rdquo;</b>: A chaotic good character acts as
his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of
him. He makes his own way, but he&rsquo;s kind and benevolent. He believes in
goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He
hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do.
He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree
with that of society.</p><p>


Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it
combines a good heart with a free spirit.</p><p>


<a id="lawful-neutral"></a><a id="judge"></a><b>Lawful Neutral, &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;</b>: A lawful neutral character
acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her. Order and
organization are paramount to her. She may believe in personal order
and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and
favor a strong, organized government.</p><p>


Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it
means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.</p><p>


<a id="true-neutral"></a><a id="undecided"></a><b>Neutral, &ldquo;Undecided&rdquo;</b>: A neutral character does what
seems to be a good idea. She doesn&rsquo;t feel strongly one way or the other
when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral
characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a
commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better
than evil&mdash;after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers
than evil ones. Still, she&rsquo;s not personally committed to upholding good
in any abstract or universal way.</p><p>


Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves
philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as
prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of
neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.</p><p>


Neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you
act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.</p><p>


<a id="chaotic-neutral"></a><a id="free-spirit"></a><b>Chaotic Neutral, &ldquo;Free Spirit&rdquo;</b>: A chaotic neutral
character follows his whims. He is an individualist first and last. He
values his own liberty but doesn&rsquo;t strive to protect others&rsquo; freedom.
He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A
chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations
as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be
motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and
a desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic
neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally
random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.</p><p>


Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it
represents true freedom from both society&rsquo;s restrictions and a
do-gooder&rsquo;s zeal.</p><p>


<a id="lawful-evil"></a><a id="dominator"></a><b>Lawful Evil, &ldquo;Dominator&rdquo;</b>: A lawful evil villain
methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of
conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He cares about tradition,
loyalty, and order but not about freedom, dignity, or life. He plays by
the rules but without mercy or compassion. He is comfortable in a
hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He condemns
others not according to their actions but according to race, religion,
homeland, or social rank. He is loath to break laws or promises. This
reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends
on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds.
Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing
in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children
come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these
compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.</p><p>


Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to
evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond
being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in
spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as
part of a duty to an evil deity or master.</p><p>


Lawful evil is sometimes called &ldquo;diabolical,&rdquo; because devils
are the epitome of lawful evil.</p><p>


Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it
represents methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.</p><p>


<a id="neutral-evil"></a><a id="malefactor"></a><b>Neutral Evil, &ldquo;Malefactor&rdquo;</b>: A neutral evil villain does
whatever she can get away with. She is out for herself, pure and
simple. She sheds no tears for those she kills, whether for profit,
sport, or convenience. She has no love of order and holds no illusion
that following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any better or
more noble. On the other hand, she doesn&rsquo;t have the restless nature or
love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has.</p><p>


Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal,
committing evil for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted
to evil deities or secret societies.</p><p>


Neutral evil is the most dangerous alignment because it
represents pure evil without honor and without variation.</p><p>


<a id="chaotic-evil"></a><a id="destroyer"></a><b>Chaotic Evil, &ldquo;Destroyer&rdquo;</b>: A chaotic evil character
does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to
do. He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and
unpredictable. If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is
ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and
chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any
groups he joins or forms are poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil
people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader
lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate
him.</p><p>


Chaotic evil is sometimes called &ldquo;demonic&rdquo; because demons are
the epitome of chaotic evil.</p><p>


Chaotic evil is the most dangerous alignment because it
represents the destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the
order on which beauty and life depend.</p>


<h3><a id="vital-statistics"></a>VITAL STATISTICS</h3>




<h5><a id="age"></a>AGE</h5>


<p class="initial">You can choose or randomly generate your
character&rsquo;s age. If you choose it, it must be at least the minimum age
for the character&rsquo;s race and class (see Table: Random Starting Ages).
Your character&rsquo;s minimum starting age is the adulthood age of his or
her race plus the number of dice indicated in the entry corresponding
to the character&rsquo;s race and class on Table: Random Starting Ages.</p><p>


Alternatively, refer to Table: Random Starting Ages and roll
dice to determine how old your character is.</p><p>

<p>With age, a character&rsquo;s physical ability scores decrease and
his or her mental ability scores increase (see Table: Aging Effects).
The effects of each aging step are cumulative. However, none of a
character&rsquo;s ability scores can be reduced below 1 in this way.</p><p>


When a character reaches venerable age, secretly roll his or
her maximum age, which is the number from the Venerable column on
Table: Aging Effects plus the result of the dice roll indicated on the
Maximum Age column on that table, and records the result, which the
player does not know. A character who reaches his or her maximum age
dies of old age at some time during the following year.</p><p>


The maximum ages are for player characters. Most people in the
world at large die from pestilence, accidents, infections, or violence
before getting to venerable age.</p><p>
