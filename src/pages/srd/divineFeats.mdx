attack bonus +4, <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="featsAll.html#blind-fight">Blind-Fight</a>, Wisdom 19.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> Using senses
such as acute hearing and sensitivity to vibrations, you detect the
location of opponents who are no more than 5 feet away from you. <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible">Invisibility</a> and

music, <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> 12 ranks.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> You have
mastered the art of casting spells unobtrusively, mingling verbal and
somatic components into its music and performances so that others
rarely catch you in the act of casting a spell. Like a silent, stilled
spell, a disguised spell can&rsquo;t be identified through <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a>.
Your performance is obvious to everyone in the vicinity, but the fact
that you are casting a spell isn&rsquo;t. Unless the spell visibly
emanates from you or observers have some other means of determining its
source, they don&rsquo;t know where the effect came from. A disguised
spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s
actual level.</p>

one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. When

time.</p>
<h5><a id="eyes-in-the-back-of-your-head"></a>EYES IN THE BACK
OF YOUR HEAD [GENERAL]</h5>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> Base
attack bonus +3, Wis 19.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> Attackers do
not gain the usual +2 attack bonus when flanking you. This feat grants
no effect whenever you are attacked without benefit of your Dexterity
modifier to AC, such as when you are flat-footed or when you are the

threaten.</p>

spell has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent spell must have a
personal range or a fixed range. Spells of instantaneous duration
cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose effects are
discharged.&nbsp; You need not concentrate on spells such as <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="spellsDtoE.html#detect-magic">detect
magic</a> or <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="spellsDtoE.html#detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a> to be aware
of the mere presence of absence of
the things detected, but you must still concentrate to gain additional
information as normal.&nbsp; Concentration on such a spell is a
standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.&nbsp; A
persistent spell uses up a spell slot six levels higher than the
spell&rsquo;s actual level.</p>
<h5><a id="plant-control"></a>PLANT CONTROL [GENERAL]</h5>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#plant-defiance">Plant

style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="specialAttacks.html#turn">turn</a>
(but not destroy) plant creatures as a good cleric turns undead. When
determining the result of a turning attempt, treat all destruction
results as normal turning. Treat immobile plant creatures as creatures
unable to flee. This ability is usable a total number of times per day
equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You use your highest caster level

<h5><a id="power-critical"></a>POWER CRITICAL [GENERAL]</h5>

<h5><a id="reach-spell"></a>REACH SPELL [METAMAGIC]</h5>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> You may cast a
spell that normally has a range of touch at any distance up to 30 feet.
The spell effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed at a ranged
touch attack to bestow the spell upon the recipient. A reach spell uses
up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.

<h5><a id="repeat-spell"></a>REPEAT SPELL [METAMAGIC]</h5>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> Any other
metamagic feat.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> A repeated
spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next round
of actions. No matter where you are, the secondary spell originates
from the same location and affects the same area as the primary spell.
If the repeated spell designates a target, the secondary spell
retargets the same target if the target is within 30 feet of its
original position; otherwise the secondary spell fails to go off. A
repeated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the
spell&rsquo;s actual level. Repeat Spell cannot be used on spells with
a range of touch.</p>
<h5><a id="sacred-spell"></a>SACRED SPELL [METAMAGIC]</h5>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> Half of the
damage dealt by a sacred spell results directly from divine power and
is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from elements
or similar magic. The other half of the damage dealt by the spell is as
normal. A sacred spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the
spell&rsquo;s actual level. Only divine spells can be cast as sacred
spells.

only receive a +2 bonus to Armor class due to cover.&nbsp; This feat
has no effect against foes with no cover or total cover.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Normal:</span> Cover normally
gives a +4 bonus to AC.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special:</span> A fighter may
select Sharp-Shooting as one of his bonus feats.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> When
employing a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic
designator, you can modify the spell to deal subdual damage instead of

damage dealt. </p>
