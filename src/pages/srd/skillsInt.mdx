<h2>Skills</h2>
<h2 style="margin-top: -40px; margin-bottom: 0px"><span class="subtitle">Intelligence-Based</span>
</h2>
<h5>APPRAISE (INT)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: You can appraise common or
well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you
estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual
value.</p>
<p>Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check
against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate
the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on
Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed,
such as a gem. A merchant&#8217;s scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on
Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight,
including anything made of precious metals. These bonuses stack.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten
consecutive full-round actions).</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: No. You cannot try again on the same object,
regardless of success.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise
checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are
familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of
stone or metal).</p>
<p>The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise
checks.</p>
<p>A character with the <a href="featsAll.html#diligent"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Diligent</a> feat gets a +2 bonus on
Appraise checks.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 ranks in any <a
href="skillsAll.html#craft" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Craft</a>
skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made
with that Craft skill.</p>
<p><b>Untrained</b>: For common items, failure on an untrained
check means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of
50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).</p>
<h5>CRAFT (INT)</h5>
<p class="initial">Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft
is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft
skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.</p>
<p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something.
If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the
heading of a Profession skill.</p>
<p><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent
living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of
dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to
perform the craft&#8217;s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers,
and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants
earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
<p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow
you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the
complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and
the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular
item. The item&#8217;s finished price also determines the cost of raw
materials.</p>
<p>In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the
results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you
must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make
articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction
with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items
that have the strength of steel.</p>
<p>When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an
appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
<p>All crafts require artisan&#8217;s tools to give the best chance of
success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a &#8211;2
circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan&#8217;s tools
provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
<p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item,
follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the item&#8217;s price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp
= 10 sp).</li>
<li>Find the DC from the table below.</li>
<li>Pay one-third of the item&#8217;s price for the cost of raw
materials.</li>
<li>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week&#8217;s
work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If
the result &times; the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you
have completed the item. (If the result &times; the DC equals double or
triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you&#8217;ve completed
the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the
DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result &times; the DC
doesn&#8217;t equal the price, then it represents the progress you&#8217;ve made
this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next
week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the
price of the item in silver pieces.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this
week.</p>
<p>If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and
have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
<p><i>Progress by the Day</i>: You can make checks by the day
instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result
&times; DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.</p>
<p><i>Creating Masterwork Items</i>: You can make a masterwork
item&#8212;a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on
its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being
magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork
component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard
item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon
or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once
both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed,
the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the
masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is
for the cost in raw materials.</p>
<p><i>Repairing Items</i>: Generally, you can repair an item by
making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the
first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item&#8217;s
price. </p>
<p>When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of
item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are
typically as given on the following table.</p>

</table>
<p><b>Action</b>: Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the
day or week (see above).</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more,
you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw
material cost again.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A dwarf has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks
that are related to stone or metal, because dwarves are especially
capable with stonework and metalwork.</p>
<p>A gnome has a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks
because gnomes have sensitive noses.</p>
<p>You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an
item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you&#8217;ll be
multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine
progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make
each weekly or daily check.</p>
<p>To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have
alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a
city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to
make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to
come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist&#8217;s lab
grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you
have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of
any items made using the skill.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get
a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#appraise"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Appraise</a> checks related to items
made with that Craft skill.</p>
<h5>DECIPHER SCRIPT (INT; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: You can decipher writing in an
unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic
form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard
texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.</p>
<p>If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a
piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check
fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false
conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false
conclusion; failure means that you do.)</p>
<p>Both the Decipher Script check and (if necessary) the Wisdom
check are made secretly, so that you can&#8217;t tell whether the conclusion
you draw is true or false.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Deciphering the equivalent of a single page of
script takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: No.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A character with the <a
href="featsAll.html#diligent" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Diligent</a>
feat gets a +2 bonus on Decipher Script checks.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a
href="skillsAll.html#decipher-script" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Decipher
Script</a>, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks involving
scrolls.</p>
<h5>DISABLE DEVICE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: The Disable Device check is made
secretly, so that you don&#8217;t necessarily know whether you&#8217;ve succeeded.
The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or
jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and
complex devices have higher DCs.</p>
<p>If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by
4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more,
something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you&#8217;re
attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but
it still works normally.</p>
<p>You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon
wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time
later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><b>Action</b>: The amount of time needed to make a Disable
Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple
device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or
complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. You can retry if you have missed the
check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you have failed in
order to try again.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a
href="featsAll.html#nimble-fingers" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Nimble
Fingers</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable Device checks.</p>
<p>A rogue who beats a trap&#8217;s DC by 10 or more can study the
trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her
companions) without disarming it.</p>
<p><b>Restriction</b>: Rogues (and other characters with the
trapfinding class feature) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap
generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create
it.</p>
<p>The spells fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and
teleportation circle also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a
successful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike stones,
however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not
succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>
<h6>Other Ways to Beat a Trap</h6>
<p class="initial">It&#8217;s possible to ruin many traps without
making a Disable Device check.</p>
<p><b>Ranged Attack Traps</b>: Once a trap&#8217;s location is known,
the obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism&#8212;assuming the
mechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it&#8217;s possible to plug up the
holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap
from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through
the plugs.</p>
<p><b>Melee Attack Traps</b>: These devices can be thwarted by
smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above.
Alternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might
be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who
is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4
dodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the
next minute.</p>
<p><b>Pits</b>: Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the
trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a
makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the
Disable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the
bottom of a pit by attacking them&#8212;they break just as daggers do.</p>
<p><b>Magic Traps</b>: Dispel magic helps here. Someone who
succeeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap&#8217;s
creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a
targeted dispel magic, not the area version (see the spell description).</p>
<h5>FORGERY (INT)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: Forgery requires writing
materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or
sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you&#8217;re writing, wax
for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which
the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a
government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to
have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your
check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to
copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document
written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that
person&#8217;s handwriting is needed.</p>
<p>The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you&#8217;re not sure
how good your forgery is. As with <a href="skillsAll.html#diguise"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Disguise</a>, you don&#8217;t even need to
make a check until someone examines the work. Your Forgery check is
opposed by the Forgery check of the person who examines the document to
check its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers on his or her
check if any of the conditions on the table below exist.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous
knowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person
checking the document can increase that character&#8217;s suspicion (and thus
create favorable circumstances for the checker&#8217;s opposing Forgery
check).</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Forging a very short and simple document takes
about 1 minute. A longer or more complex document takes 1d4 minutes per
page.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Usually, no. A retry is never possible after
a particular reader detects a particular forgery. But the document
created by the forger might still fool someone else. The result of a
Forgery check for a particular document must be used for every instance
of a different reader examining the document. No reader can attempt to
detect a particular forgery more than once; if that one opposed check
goes in favor of the forger, then the reader can&#8217;t try using his own
skill again, even if he&#8217;s suspicious about the document.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a
href="featsAll.html#deceitful" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Deceitful</a>
feat, you get a +2 bonus on Forgery checks.</p>
<p><b>Restriction</b>: Forgery is language-dependent; thus, to
forge documents and detect forgeries, you must be able to read and
write the language in question. A barbarian can&#8217;t learn the Forgery
skill unless he has learned to read and write.</p>
<h5>KNOWLEDGE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>
<p class="initial">Like the Craft and Profession skills,
Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge
represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even
scientific discipline.</p>
<p>Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane
symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</li>
<li>Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts,
bridges, fortifications)</li>
<li>Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</li>
<li>Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</li>
<li>History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of
cities)</li>
<li>Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs,
traditions, humanoids)</li>
<li>Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants,
seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)</li>
<li>Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees,
mottoes, personalities)</li>
<li>Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic
tradition, holy symbols, undead)</li>
<li>The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral
Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the
planes)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Check</b>: Answering a question within your field of study
has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions),
or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>
<p>In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and
their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a
check equals 10 + the monster&#8217;s HD. A successful check allows you to
remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5
points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another
piece of useful information.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge
check doesn&#8217;t take an action&#8212;you simply know the answer or you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: No. The check represents what you know, and
thinking about a topic a second time doesn&#8217;t let you know something
that you never learned in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge
(arcana), you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#spellcraft"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spellcraft</a> checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and
engineering), you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#search"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a> checks made to find
secret doors or hidden compartments.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get
a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#survival"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Survival</a> checks made to keep
from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a
+2 bonus on bardic knowledge checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2
bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#gather-information"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Gather Information</a> checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a
+2 bonus on Survival checks made in aboveground natural environments
(aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, or plains).</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and
royalty), you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Diplomacy</a> checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a
+2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get
a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you
get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on
Knowledge (nature) checks.</p>
<p><b>Untrained</b>: An untrained Knowledge check is simply an
Intelligence check. Without actual training, you know only common
knowledge (DC 10 or lower).</p>
<h5>SEARCH (INT)</h5>
<p><b>Check</b>: You generally must be within 10 feet of the
object or surface to be searched. The table below gives DCs for typical
tasks involving the Search skill.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><b>Action</b>: It takes a full-round action to search a
5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Search checks,
and a half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a half-elf) who
simply passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can make a
Search check to find that door.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#investigator"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Investigator</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Search checks.</p>
<p>The spells explosive runes, fire trap, glyph of warding,
symbol, and teleportation circle create magic traps that a rogue can
find by making a successful Search check and then can attempt to disarm
by using <a href="skillsAll.html#disable-device"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Disable Device</a>. Identifying the
location of a snare spell has a DC of 23. Spike growth and spike stones
create magic traps that can be found using Search, but against which
Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell
descriptions for details.</p>
<p>Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24
hours or more create barely visible energy fluctuations. These
fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on Search checks to locate such
abjuration spells.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get
a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#survival"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Survival</a> checks to find or
follow tracks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in <a
href="skillsAll.html#knowledge" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Knowledge</a>
(architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to
find secret doors or hidden compartments.</p>
<p><b>Restriction</b>: While anyone can use Search to find a trap
whose DC is 20 or lower, only a rogue can use Search to locate traps
with higher DCs. (Exception: The spell find traps temporarily enables a
cleric to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)</p>
<p>A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill
to find a difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is
built into or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search
check from his stonecunning ability.</p>
