<a id="divine-ranks"></a><h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Divine Ranks</span></h5>
Each deity has a divine rank. A deity&rsquo;s divine rank determines
how much power the entity has.
<a id="divine-rank-0"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 0:</span> Creatures of
this
rank are sometimes called quasi-deities or hero deities. Creatures that
have a mortal and a deity as parents also fall into this category.
These entities cannot grant spells, but are immortal and usually have
one or more ability scores that are far above the norm for their
species. They may have
some worshipers. Ordinary mortals do not have a divine rank of 0. They
lack a divine rank altogether.</p>
<a id="divine-rank-1-5"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 1-5:</span> These
entities,
called demigods, are the weakest of the deities. A demigod can grant
spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits. A demigod
has anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand devoted mortal
worshipers and may receive veneration or respect from many more. A
demigod controls a small godly realm (usually on an Outer Plane) and
has minor control over a portfolio that includes one or more aspects of
mortal existence. A demigod might be very accomplished in a single
skill or a group of related skills, gain combat advantages in special
circumstances, or be able to bring about minor changes in reality
itself related to the portfolio.</p>
<a id="divine-rank-6-10"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 6-10:</span> Called
lesser
deities, these entities grant spells and can perform more powerful
deeds than demigods can. Lesser deities have anywhere from a few
thousand to tens of thousands of worshipers and control larger godly
realms than demigods. They also have keener senses where their
portfolios are concerned.</p>
<a id="divine-rank-11-15"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 11-15:</span> These
entities are called intermediate deities. They have hundreds of
thousands of mortal worshipers and control larger godly realms than
demigods or lesser deities.</p>
<a id="divine-rank-16-20"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 16-20:</span> Called
greater deities, these entities may have millions of mortal worshipers,
and they command respect even among other deities. The most powerful of
greater deities rule over other deities just as mortal sovereigns rule
over commoners.</p>
<a id="divine-rank-21-plus"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 21+:</span> These
entities
are beyond the ken of mortals and care nothing for worshipers. They do
not grant spells, do not answer prayers, and do not respond to queries.
If they are known at all, it is to a handful of scholars on the
Material Plane. They are called overdeities. In some pantheistic
systems, the consent of an overdeity is required to become a god.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics"></a><h5>Divine Characteristics</h5>
Most deities are creatures of the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="monsterTypes.html#outsider">outsider type</a> (usually with
20 outsider Hit Dice). All deities that are outsiders have all
alignment subtypes that correspond with their alignment.&nbsp; Unlike
other outsiders, they have no darkvision unless noted in the deity
description. Deities&rsquo; physical characteristics vary from deity to
deity. A deity&rsquo;s outsider type, along with its class or classes,
determines its weapon proficiencies, feats, and skills. Deities have
some or all of the following additional qualities, depending on their
divine rank.
<a id="divine-characteristics-level"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Levels:</span> Most deities
are 20 HD outsiders with 30 to 50 character levels as well. These
additional character levels beyond an effective character level of 20th
follow the rules for <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="epicLevels.html">epic</a> levels.

Character levels above 20th confer some, but not all, of the benefits
of normal levels. Deities gain all the class features for all their
levels. The deity also gains the normal Hit Die for that class, plus
additional skill points as if the deity had a level in that class
normally. The deity gains an ability bonus every four levels, and a
feat every three levels.

Beyond character level 20th, deities&rsquo; attack and saving throw
bonuses increase at new rates. Deities gain a +1 epic attack bonus at
21st level and every other level thereafter. No deity can have more
than four attacks derived strictly from its base attack bonus.&nbsp;
Deities also gain a +1 bonus on saving throws at 22nd level and every
other level thereafter.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-hit-points"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Points:</span> Deities
receive maximum hit points for each Hit Die.

<a id="divine-characteristics-speed"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speed:</span> Deities can
move much more quickly than mortals. A deity&rsquo;s base land speed
depends on its form (biped or quadruped) and its size, as shown on the
following table. Some deities are exceptions, with speeds faster or
slower than the norm.</p>
<a id="table-deity-base-land-speed"></a><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> Use the Biped
column for burrow and swim speeds for all
deities regardless of form. Use half the value in the Biped column for
climb speeds for all deities. Use twice the value in the Quadruped
column for fly speeds for all deities capable of flying.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-armor-class"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Class:</span> A field
of divine energy encompasses a deity&rsquo;s body, granting it a divine
Armor Class bonus equal to its divine rank. This bonus stacks with all
other Armor Class bonuses and is effective against touch attacks and
incorporeal touch attacks.

Most deities (all those with 20 outsider Hit Dice) have a natural armor
bonus of their divine rank +13. All deities also have a deflection
bonus to their AC equal to their Charisma bonus (if any).

Deities who aren&rsquo;t outsiders have their normal natural armor
bonus + their divine rank.

Many deities have other Armor Class bonuses as noted in their
individual descriptions.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-attacks"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attacks:</span> A
deity&rsquo;s Hit Dice and type and character level determine its base
attack bonus. In addition to the figures for weapon attacks, this
section of the statistics block also includes melee touch attack and
ranged touch attack bonuses, to be used when the deity casts a spell or
uses a spell-like ability that requires a touch attack to affect its
target. A deity gets its divine rank as a divine bonus on all attack
rolls. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not automatically fail on a
natural attack roll of 1.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-bypassing-damage-reduction"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Bypassing Damage Reduction:</span>
As outsiders with alignment subtypes, the
natural attacks of deities, as well as any weapons they wield, are
considered aligned the same as the deity for the purposes of bypassing <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="monsterTypes.html#DR">damage
reduction</a>.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-always-maximize-roll"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Always Maximize Roll:</span>
Greater deities (rank 16-20) automatically get the best result possible
on any check, saving throw, attack roll, or damage roll. Calculate
success, failure, or other effects accordingly. When a greater deity
makes a check, attack, or save assume a 20 was rolled and calculate
success or failure from there. A d20 should still be rolled and used to
check for a threat of a critical hit.&nbsp; This quality means that
greater deities never need the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="featsAll.html#maximize-spell">Maximize Spell</a> feat, because
their
spells have maximum effect already.

</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-saving-throw"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throws:</span> A
deity&rsquo;s outsider Hit Dice and character level determine its base
saving throw bonuses. A deity gets its divine rank as a divine bonus on
all saving throws. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not automatically
fail on a natural saving throw roll of 1.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-checks"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Checks:</span> A deity gets
its divine rank as a divine bonus on all skill checks, ability checks,
caster level checks, and turning checks. Lesser deities (rank 6-10) may
take 10 on any check, provided they need to make a check at all.
Intermediate and greater deities (rank 11-20) always get a result of 20
on any check, provided they need to make a check at all.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-synergy-bonuses"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deities and Synergy Bonuses:</span>
For every 20 extra ranks a deity has in a skill, the deity&rsquo;s
synergy bonus from the skill (if any) increases by +2.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-immunities-"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Immunities:</span> Deities
have the following immunities. Individual deities may have more
immunities. Unless otherwise indicated, these immunities do not apply
if the attacker is a deity of equal or higher rank.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-immunities-transmutation"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Transmutation:</span> A
deity
is immune to <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="spellsAtoB.html#baleful-polymorph">polymorphing</a>, <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#petrified">petrification</a>, or any
other attack that
alters its form. Any shape-altering powers the deity might have work
normally on itself.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-immunities-energy-drain-ability-drain-ability-damage"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Energy Drain, Ability Drain,
Ability Damage:</span> A deity is not subject to <a

href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#energy-drained">energy drain</a>, <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"

<a id="divine-characteristics-immunities-mind-affecting-effects"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Mind-Affecting Effects:</span>
A deity is immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,
phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-energy-immunity"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy Immunity:</span>
Deities of rank 1 or higher are immune to electricity, cold, and acid,
even if the attacker is a deity of higher divine rank. Some deities
have additional energy immunities.

Deities of rank 1 or higher are immune to <a

<p>If the deity also has damage reduction from another source
this damage
reduction does not stack with the damage reduction granted by divine
ranks. Instead, the deity gets the benefit of the best damage reduction
in a given situation. Whenever a deity has a second kind of damage
reduction that might apply to an attack, that damage reduction is
listed in parentheses after the damage reduction entry in the
deity&rsquo;s statistics block.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-resistances"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resistances:</span> All
deities have at least the following resistances.&nbsp;
Individual deities may have additional resistances.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-energy-resistance"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Energy Resistance:</span> A
deity has <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy">fire resistance</a> of 5
+ its
divine rank.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-spell-resistance"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spell Resistance:</span> A
deity has <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="monsterTypes.html#SR">spell resistance</a> of 32 + its
divine rank.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-salient-divine-abilities"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Salient Divine Abilities:</span>
Every deity of rank 1 or higher has at least
one additional power, called a salient divine ability, per divine rank
(see Salient Divine Abilities).</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-domain-powers"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Domain Powers:</span> A deity
of rank 1 or higher can use any domain power it
can grant a number of times per day equal to its divine rank (if the
power normally can be used more often than that, the deity gets the
greater number of uses). If a domain power is based on a cleric&rsquo;s
level (or one-half a cleric&rsquo;s level), a deity with no cleric
levels has an effective cleric level equal to the deity&rsquo;s divine
rank (or one-half the deity&rsquo;s divine rank) for this purpose.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-spell-like-abilities"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell-Like Abilities:</span>
A deity can use any domain spell it can grant as
a spell-like ability at will. The deity&rsquo;s effective caster level
for such abilities is 10 + the deity&rsquo;s divine rank. The saving
throw DC for such abilities is 10 + the spell level + the deity&rsquo;s
Charisma bonus (if any) + the deity&rsquo;s divine rank.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-immortality"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Immortality:</span> All
deities (even those of rank 0) are naturally immortal
and cannot die from natural causes. Deities do not age, and they do not
need to eat, sleep, or breathe. The only way for a deity to die is
through special circumstances, usually by being slain in magical or
physical combat. Deities of rank 1 or higher are not subject to death
from massive damage.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-senses"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Senses:</span> Deities of
rank 1 or higher have incredibly sensitive
perception. Such a deity&rsquo;s senses (including darkvision and
low-light vision, if the deity has them) extend out to a radius of one
mile per divine rank. Perception is limited to the senses a deity
possesses. A deity cannot see through solid objects without using its
remote sensing ability or some sort of x-ray vision power.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-remote-sensing"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Sensing:</span> As a
standard action, a deity of rank 1 or
higher can perceive everything within a radius of one mile per rank
around any of its worshipers, holy sites, or other objects or locales
sacred to the deity. This supernatural effect can also be centered on
any place where someone speaks the deity&rsquo;s name or title for up
to 1 hour after the name is spoken, and at any location when an event
related to the deity&rsquo;s portfolio occurs.The remote sensing power
can cross planes and penetrate any barrier except a divine shield
(described in Salient Divine Abilities) or an area otherwise blocked by
a deity of equal or higher rank. Remote sensing is not fooled by <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="spellsMtoO.html#misdirection">misdirection</a>
or <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="spellsMtoO.html#nondetection">nondetection</a>
or similar spells, and it does not create
a magical sensor that other creatures can detect. A deity can extend
its senses to two or more remote locations at once (depending on divine
rank) and still sense what&rsquo;s going on nearby.</p>

<p>Once a deity chooses a remote location to sense, it
automatically
receives sensory information from that location until it chooses a new
location to sense, or until it can&rsquo;t sense the location.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-block-sensing"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Block Sensing:</span> As a
standard action, a deity of rank 1 or
higher can block the sensing ability of other deities of its rank or
lower. This power extends for a radius of one mile per rank of the
deity, or within the same distance around a temple or other locale
sacred to the deity, or the same distance around a portfolio-related
event. The deity can block two remote locations at once, plus the area
within one mile of itself. The blockage lasts 1 hour per divine rank.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-portfolio"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Portfolio:</span> Every deity
of rank 1 or higher has at least limited
knowledge and control over some aspect of mortal existence. A
deity&rsquo;s connection to its portfolio gives it a number of powers.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-portfolio-sense"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Portfolio Sense:</span>
Demigods have a limited ability to sense
events involving their portfolios. They automatically sense any event
that involves one thousand or more people. The ability is limited to
the present. Lesser deities automatically sense any event that involves
their portfolios and affects five hundred or more people. Intermediate
deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios,
regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses
extend one week into the past for every divine rank they have. Greater
deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios,
regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses
extend one week into the past and one week into the future for every
divine rank they have. When a deity senses an event, it merely knows
that the event is occurring and where it is. The deity receives no
sensory information about the event. Once a deity notices an event, it
can use its remote sensing power to perceive the event.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-automatic-actions"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Automatic Actions:</span>
When performing an action within its portfolio, a
deity can perform any action as a free action, as long as the check DC
is equal to or less than the number on the table below. The number of
free actions a deity can perform each round is also determined by the
deity&rsquo;s divine rank.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Create Magic Items:</span> A
deity of rank 1 or higher can create magic items
related to its portfolio without any requisite item creation feat,
provided that the deity possesses all other prerequisites for the item.
The maximum item value a deity can create is a function of its divine
rank (see the table below). The item&rsquo;s cost and creation time
remain unchanged, but the deity is free to undertake any activity when
not laboring on the item.</p>

it wishes

<a id="divine-characteristics-divine-aura"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Divine Aura:</span> The mere
presence of a deity of rank 1 or higher can
deeply affect mortals and beings of lower divine rank. All divine aura
effects are mind-affecting, extraordinary abilities. Mortals and other
deities of lower rank can resist the aura&rsquo;s effects with
successful Will saves; the DC is 10 + the deity&rsquo;s rank + the
deity&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. Deities are immune to the auras of
deities of equal or lower rank. Any being who makes a successful saving
throw against a deity&rsquo;s aura power becomes immune to that
deity&rsquo;s aura power for one day. Divine aura is an emanation that
extends around the deity in a radius whose size is a function of divine
rank. The deity chooses the size of the radius and can change it as a
free action. If the deity chooses a radius of 0 feet, its aura power
effectively becomes non-functional. When two or more deities&rsquo;
auras cover the same area, only the aura that belongs to the deity with
the highest rank functions. If divine ranks are equal, the auras
coexist.</p>

<p>The deity can make its own worshipers, beings of its

<a id="divine-characteristics-divne-aura-resolve"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Resolve:</span> The
deity&rsquo;s allies receive a +4 morale bonus on
attack rolls, saves, and checks, while the deity&rsquo;s foes receive a
-4 morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-grant-spells"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grant Spells:</span> A deity
automatically grants spells and domain powers to
mortal divine spellcasters who pray to it. Most deities can grant
spells from the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"

can grant
spells from the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"

levels can
grant spells from the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="paladinSpells.html">paladin spell list</a>. A deity can withhold
spells
from any particular mortal as a free action; once a spell has been
granted, it remains in the mortal&rsquo;s mind until expended.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-spontaneous-casting"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spontaneous Casting:</span> A
deity of rank 1 or higher who has levels in a
divine spellcasting class can spontaneously cast any spell it can
grant. </p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-communication"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Communication:</span> A deity
of rank 1 or higher can understand, speak, and
read any language, including nonverbal languages. The deity can speak
directly to any beings within one mile of itself per divine rank.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-remote-communication"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Communication:</span>
As a standard action, a deity of rank 1
or higher can send a communication to a remote location. The deity can
speak to any of its own worshipers, and to anyone within one mile per
rank away from a site dedicated to the deity, or within one mile per
rank away from a statue or other likeness of the deity. The creature
being contacted can receive a telepathic message that only it can hear.
Alternatively, the deity&rsquo;s voice can seem to issue from the air,
the ground, or from some object of the deity&rsquo;s choosing (but not
an object or locale dedicated to another deity of equal or higher rank
than the deity who is speaking). In the latter case, anyone within
earshot of the sound can hear it. The deity can send a manifestation or
omen instead of a spoken or telepathic message. The exact nature of
this communication varies with the deity, but it usually is some
visible phenomenon. A deity&rsquo;s communication power can cross
planes and penetrate any barrier. Once communication is initiated, the
deity can continue communicating as a free action until it decides to
end the communication. A deity can carry on as many remote
communications at one time as it can remote sense at one time (see
Remote Sensing, above).</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-godly-realm"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Godly Realm:</span> Each
deity of rank 1 or higher has a location that serves
as a workplace, personal residence, audience chamber, and sometimes as
a retreat or fortress. A deity is at its most powerful within its godly
realm. A deity has at least modest control over the environment within
its realm, controlling the temperature and minor elements of the
environment. The radius of this control is a function of the
deity&rsquo;s rank and whether the realm is located on an Outer Plane
or some other plane (including the Material Plane).</p>

<p>Within this area, the deity can set any temperature that is
normal for
the plane where the realm is located (for the Material Plane, any
temperature from -20&ordm;F to 120&ordm;F), and fill the area with
scents and sounds as the deity sees fit. Sounds can be no louder than
one hundred humans could make, but not intelligible speech or harmful
sound. The deity&rsquo;s ability to create scents is similar. Deities
of rank 6 or higher can create the sounds of intelligible speech. A
demigod or lesser deity can erect buildings and alter the landscape,
but must do so through its own labor, through magic, or through its
divine powers. A deity of rank 6 or higher not only has control over
the environment, but also controls links to the Astral Plane.
Manipulating a realm&rsquo;s astral links renders teleportation and
similar effects useless within the realm. The deity can designate
certain locales within the realm where astral links remain intact.
Likewise, the deity can block off the realm from planar portals or
designate locations where portals are possible. A deity of rank 11 or
higher can also apply the enhanced magic or impeded magic trait to up
to four groups of spells (schools, domains, or spells with the same
descriptor). The enhanced magic trait enables a metamagic feat to be
applied to a group of spells without requiring higher-level spell
slots. Many deities apply the enhanced magic trait to their domain
spells, making them maximized (as the <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="featsAll.html#maximize-spell">Maximize
Spell</a> feat) within the
boundaries of their realm. The impeded magic trait doesn&rsquo;t affect
the deity&rsquo;s spells and spell-like abilities.

In addition, a deity of rank 11 or higher can erect buildings
as desired and alter terrain within ten miles to become any terrain
type found on the Material Plane. These buildings and alterations are
manifestations of the deity&rsquo;s control over the realm.

A greater deity (rank 16 or higher) also can perform any one
of the following acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change or apply a gravity trait within the realm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change or apply an elemental or energy trait within the
realm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change or apply a time trait within the realm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apply the limited magic trait to a particular school,
domain, or spell descriptor within the area, preventing such spells and
spell-like abilities from functioning. The greater deity&rsquo;s own
spells and spell-like abilities are not limited by these restrictions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a deity sets the conditions in its realm, they are
permanent, though the deity can change them. As a standard action, the
deity can specify a new environmental condition. The change gradually
takes effect over the next 10 minutes. Changing astral links, planar
traits, or terrain requires more effort, and the deity must labor for a
year and a day to change them. During this time, the deity must spend 8
hours a day on the project. During the remaining 16 hours of each day,
the deity can perform any action it desires, so long as it remains
within the realm. The astral links, planar traits, and terrain remain
unchanged until the labor is complete. </p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-travel"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Travel:</span> A deity of
rank 1 or higher can use <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="spellsTtoZ.html#greater-teleport">greater
teleport</a> as a
spell-like ability at will, as the spell cast by a 20th-level
character, except that the deity can transport only itself and up to
100 pounds of objects per divine rank. A deity of rank 6 or higher also
can use <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="spellsPtoR.html#plane-shift">plane shift</a> as a spell-like
ability at will, as the spell cast
by a 20th-level character, except that the deity can only transport
itself and up to 100 pounds of objects. If the deity has a familiar,
personal mount, or personal intelligent weapon, the creature can
accompany the deity in any mode of travel if the deity touches it. The
creature&rsquo;s weight counts against the deity&rsquo;s weight limit.</p>
<a id="divine-characteristics-familiar"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Familiar:</span> A deity of
rank 1 or higher with levels as a <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);"
href="sorcerer.html">sorcerer</a> or a <a
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="wizard.html">wizard</a>
has the ability to treat any creature of a given kind as a
familiar, as long as that creature is within a distance of one mile per
divine rank of the deity. This special familiar ability only applies to
one creature at a time, but the deity can switch between one creature
and another instantaneously, as long as the second creature is within
range. This special familiar ability does not replace the deity&rsquo;s
ability to have a normal familiar, which could be any kind of eligible
creature.</p>
