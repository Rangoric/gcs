<h5>BALANCE (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: You can walk on a precarious
surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the
surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can&#8217;t move for 1
round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies
with the surface, as follows:</p>

</table>
<p><i>Being Attacked while Balancing</i>: You are considered
flat-footed while balancing, since you can&#8217;t move to avoid a blow, and
thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or
more ranks in Balance, you aren&#8217;t considered flat-footed while
balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another
Balance check against the same DC to remain standing.</p>
<p><i>Accelerated Movement</i>: You can try to walk across a
precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a &#8211;5
penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice
your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move
action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to <a
href="specialAttacks.html#charge" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">charge</a>
across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for
each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: None. A Balance check doesn&#8217;t require an
action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a
situation.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#agile"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Agile</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus
on Balance checks.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a
href="skillsAll.html#tumble" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Tumble</a>,
you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.</p>
<h5>ESCAPE ARTIST (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: The table below gives the DCs to
escape various forms of restraints.</p>
<p><i>Ropes</i>: Your Escape Artist check is opposed by the
binder&#8217;s Use Rope check. Since it&#8217;s easier to tie someone up than to
escape from being tied up, the binder gets a +10 bonus on his or her
check.</p>
<p><i>Manacles and Masterwork Manacles</i>: The DC for manacles
is set by their construction.</p>
<p><i>Tight Space</i>: The DC noted on the table is for getting
through a space where your head fits but your shoulders don&#8217;t. If the
space is long you may need to make multiple checks. You can&#8217;t get
through a space that your head does not fit through.</p>
<p><i>Grappler</i>: You can make an Escape Artist check opposed
by your enemy&#8217;s <a href="specialAttacks.html#grapple"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">grapple</a> check to get out of a
grapple or out of a <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#pinned"

</table>
<p><b>Action</b>: Making an Escape Artist check to escape from
rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler)
requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an animate rope,
command plants, control plants, or entangle spell is a full-round
action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing
through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending
on how long the space is.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. You can make another check after a
failed check if you&#8217;re squeezing your way through a tight space, making
multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional
checks, or even take 20, as long as you&#8217;re not being actively opposed.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#agile"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Agile</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus
on Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist,
you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#use-rope"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Use Rope</a> checks to bind someone.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on
Escape Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.</p>
<h5>HIDE (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: Your Hide check is opposed by
the <a href="skillsAll.html#spot" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a>
check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your
normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater
than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a &#8211;5 penalty.
It&#8217;s practically impossible (&#8211;20 penalty) to hide while attacking,
running or charging.</p>
<p>A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or
penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16,
Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large &#8211;4, Huge &#8211;8, Gargantuan &#8211;12,
Colossal &#8211;16.</p>
<p>You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide
check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see
Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can
see you anyway.</p>
<p>If people are observing you, even casually, you can&#8217;t hide.
You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you&#8217;re out of sight
and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went. If
your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check;
see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn
their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get
to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding
place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check,
however, is made at a &#8211;10 penalty because you have to move fast.</p>
<p><i>Sniping</i>: If you&#8217;ve already successfully hidden at least
10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then
immediately hide again. You take a &#8211;20 penalty on your Hide check to
conceal yourself after the shot.</p>
<p><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use Bluff to help
you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion
you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check
as part of movement, so it doesn&#8217;t take a separate action. However,
hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move
action.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you are <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a>, you gain a +40 bonus
on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if
you&#8217;re moving.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#stealthy"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Stealthy</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p>A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of
natural terrain, even if it doesn&#8217;t grant cover or concealment. A
17th-level ranger can do this even while being observed.</p>
<h5>MOVE SILENTLY (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: Your Move Silently check is
opposed by the <a href="skillsAll.html#listen"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a> check of anyone who might
hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty.
When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full
speed, you take a &#8211;5 penalty. It&#8217;s practically impossible (&#8211;20 penalty)
to move silently while running or charging.</p>
<p>Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move
silently across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take
a penalty on your Move Silently check as indicated below.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="width: 400px">Surface</th>
<th>Check Modifier</th>

<tr class="odd-row">

<tr>
<td class="last-row">Very noisy (dense undergrowth, deep
snow)</td>
<td class="last-row" align="center">&#8211;5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><b>Action</b>: None. A Move Silently check is included in your
movement or other activity, so it is part of another action.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: The master of a cat familiar gains a +3 bonus
on Move Silently checks.</p>
<p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#stealthy"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Stealthy</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
<h5>OPEN LOCK (DEX; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>
<p class="initial">Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of
thieves&#8217; tools imposes a &#8211;2 circumstance penalty on the check, even if
a simple tool is employed. If you use masterwork thieves&#8217; tools, you
gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
<p><b>Check</b>: The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40,
depending on the quality of the lock, as given on the table below.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>

<td class="last-row">Amazing lock</td>

<p><b>Action</b>: Opening a lock is a full-round action.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a
href="featsAll.html#nimble-fingers" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Nimble
Fingers</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on Open Lock checks.</p>
<p><b>Untrained</b>: You cannot pick locks untrained, but you
might successfully force them open.</p>
<h5>RIDE (DEX)</h5>
<p class="initial">If you attempt to ride a creature that is ill
suited as a mount, you take a &#8211;5 penalty on your Ride checks.</p>
<p><b>Check</b>: Typical riding actions don&#8217;t require checks. You
can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.</p>
<p>The following tasks do require checks.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><i>Guide with Knees</i>: You can react instantly to guide your
mount with your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make
your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use
only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control
your mount.</p>
<p><i>Stay in Saddle</i>: You can react instantly to try to avoid
falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take
damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><i>Fight with Warhorse</i>: If you direct your war-trained
mount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or
attacks normally. This usage is a free action.</p>
<p><i>Cover</i>: You can react instantly to drop down and hang
alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can&#8217;t attack or cast
spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check,
you don&#8217;t get the cover benefit. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><i>Soft Fall</i>: You can react instantly to try to take no
damage when you fall off a mount&#8212;when it is killed or when it falls,
for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of
falling damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><i>Leap</i>: You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part
of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount&#8217;s Jump modifier,
whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail
your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the
appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not
take an action, but is part of the mount&#8217;s movement.</p>
<p><i>Spur Mount</i>: You can spur your mount to greater speed
with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount&#8217;s speed
by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You
can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of
additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the
previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).</p>
<p><i>Control Mount in Battle</i>: As a move action, you can
attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not
trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check,
you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for
warhorses or warponies.</p>
<p><i>Fast Mount or Dismount</i>: You can attempt to mount or
dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself
as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available
that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a
move action. You can&#8217;t use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than
one size category larger than yourself.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a
move action. Other checks are a move action, a free action, or no
action at all, as noted above.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you are riding bareback, you take a &#8211;5
penalty on Ride checks.</p>
<p>If your mount has a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance
bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle.</p>
<p>The Ride skill is a prerequisite for the feats <a

<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a

Animal</a>, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.</p>
<h5>SLEIGHT OF HAND (DEX; TRAINED ONLY; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check
lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat
of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10
unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.</p>
<p>When you use this skill under close observation, your skill
check is opposed by the observer&#8217;s <a href="skillsAll.html#spot"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a> check. The observer&#8217;s
success doesn&#8217;t prevent you from performing the action, just from doing
it unnoticed.</p>
<p>You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an
easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand
crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the
Spot check of anyone observing you or the <a
href="skillsAll.html#search" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a>
check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a
+4 bonus on the Search check, since it&#8217;s generally easier to find such
an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light
weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to
conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken,
or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal
it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus
on the check. Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn&#8217;t
provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>If you try to take something from another creature, you must
make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a
Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand
check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent
who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether
you got the item.</p>
<p>You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as
though you were using the <a href="skillsAll.html#perform"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Perform</a> skill. In such a case,
your &#8220;act&#8221; encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.</p>

<p><b>Action</b>: Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a
standard action. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a
free action by taking a &#8211;20 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, but after an initial failure, a second
Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target (or while you are being
watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt)
increases the DC for the task by 10.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a

you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>
<p><b>Untrained</b>: An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply
a Dexterity check. Without actual training, you can&#8217;t succeed on any
Sleight of Hand check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an
object on your body.</p>
<h5>TUMBLE (DEX; TRAINED ONLY; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>
<p class="initial">You can&#8217;t use this skill if your speed has
been reduced by armor, excess equipment, or loot.</p>
<p><b>Check</b>: You can land softly when you fall or tumble past
opponents. You can also tumble to entertain an audience (as though
using the Perform skill). The DCs for various tasks involving the

<p><i>Accelerated Tumbling</i>: You try to tumble past or through
enemies more quickly than normal. By accepting a &#8211;10 penalty on your
Tumble checks, you can move at your full speed instead of one-half your
speed.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Not applicable. Tumbling is part of movement,
so a Tumble check is part of a move action.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Usually no. An audience, once it has judged
a tumbler as an uninteresting performer, is not receptive to repeat
performances. You can try to reduce damage from a fall as an instant
reaction only once per fall.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you
gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the
usual +2 dodge bonus to AC.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +6 dodge

<p><i>Secure a Grappling Hook</i>: Securing a grappling hook
requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the
grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by
4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing
you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling
hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting
weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don&#8217;t know whether the
rope will hold your weight.</p>
<p><i>Bind a Character</i>: When you bind another character with
a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound character makes is
opposed by your Use Rope check. You get a +10 bonus on this check
because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You
don&#8217;t even make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard
action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a
special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a
full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two
ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus
on Use Rope checks. If you cast an animate rope spell on a rope, you
get a +2 circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using
that rope. These bonuses stack.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#deft-hands"

style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Climb</a> checks made to climb a
rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on
