This variant is designed specifically for campaigns that don't offer a lot
of "downtime" to the PCs. It unifies the rules for crafting items and
creating magic items, while also replicating a character's ability to come
up with just the thing he needs for a specific task in the nick of time.
It glosses over the realities of such work-tool kits, alchemical reagents,
laboratories, long hours of toil, and the like � to keep the game moving
along at an exciting pace. After all, fighting giants, demons, and dragons
is generally a lot more fun than waiting for Klamzo to finish crafting a
new <a style="color: #579eb6" href="magicItemsPRR.html#ring-of-protection">ring of protection</a>.
<p>
To craft an item without spending the normal labor time, a character with
the appropriate item creation feat (such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#craft-masterwork-armor">Craft Masterwork Armor</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#brew-potion">Brew Potion</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#craft-staff">Craft Staff</a>; see below) can pay one-tenth the item's market
price in craft points (minimum 1 point). He must also pay material costs
equal to one-half the item's market price (this replaces the normal
material cost for crafting an item). For a magic item, the character must
also pay the normal experience point cost for crafting the item. Once the
character declares that he is spending these craft points and gold pieces
(and experience points, for a magic item), the item is automatically
completed one day later (typically the next morning).
</p>
<p>
Though this makes it appear as if the item was created "instantly," the
assumption is that the character has actually been working on it for a
while, but only now got around to finishing it. For instance, Klamzo might
have been tinkering with Kroh's sword for some time, but only now has
finished improving its enhancement bonus. The system
simply assumes that characters are always working on various projects in
their spare time, whether between forays into the dungeon, while on the
road, or even while gathered around the campfire after battling goblins in
the Sunless Citadel. Thus, when the time comes, they simply spend the
requisite gold and craft points, and the item is "finished" one day later.
</p>
<p>
To spend craft points toward the creation of an alchemical, masterwork, or
magic item, you must have the requisite Craft feat (such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#craft-masterwork-armor">Craft
Masterwork Armor</a> for creating a masterwork chain shirt) or assist someone
who does (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#assisting">Assisting</a>, below). Crafting nonmasterwork armor and weapons
or simple items � tools, chests, saddles, and the like � doesn't require a
Craft feat. Anyone who helps with the creation of such an item can
contribute craft points at the normal rate.
</p>
<p>
For nonmagical items, you must make a successful <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#craft">Craft</a> check to complete
the item. For a masterwork item, use the DC of the item or of the
masterwork component, whichever is higher. A failed check means you waste
one-half of the gold pieces and craft points required for the item, but
you may try again as soon as the next day if you still have enough gold
pieces and craft points to complete the item. Magic items require no
skill check to
complete.
</p>
<p>
You can reduce the amount of craft points required by increasing the
amount of time you spend working on the item. For nonmagical items, reduce
the craft point cost by 1 point for every 100 sp of work you contribute to
the item's creation (see the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#craft">Craft</a> skill). For magic items, each 8-hour
day spent working on the item reduces the craft point cost by 100.

<p><i>Example One:</i>
A masterwork suit of full plate armor has a market price of 1,650 gp. A
character with the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#craft-armor">Craft Armor</a> feat could pay one-third of this price and
make daily or weekly <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#craft">Craft</a> (armorsmith) checks to slowly complete the suit
of armor, or he could pay one-half of this price and spend 165 craft
points to complete it one day later with a successful DC 20 Craft check.
(A failed check at this point would cost him 412 gp and 82 craft points.)
Alternatively, he could spend some days or weeks working on the item
(making regular Craft checks), then finish it quickly by spending craft
points equal to 165 minus 1 per 100 sp of work he has already completed.
</p>
<p><i>Example Two:</i>
A +2 longsword has a market price of 8,000 gp (not including the material
cost of the masterwork longsword itself). Assuming you had the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic
Arms and Armor</a> feat (and didn't have to make the masterwork longsword from
scratch), you could either spend 8 days of time to craft the item, or you
could spend 800 craft points to finish it "instantly." (In either case,
you have to spend 4,000 gp in addition to the time or craft points.) If
you wanted, you could save 200 craft points by spending two 8-hour days
working on the item.
</p>
<h5><a id="assisting"></a>
ASSISTING
</h5>
In addition to the primary crafter who must have the appropriate Craft
feat up to three assistants can contribute craft points to the creation of
the item.
<p>
Assistants who have the appropriate Craft feat contribute craft points at
full normal value. For untrained assistants (those who don't have the
appropriate Craft feat), each craft point contributed counts as 1/2 point
of assistance.
</p>
<p>
The primary creator must contribute at least half of the craft points
required to create an item.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't matter who contributes the gold piece cost that goes toward
creating the item. Only the primary creator can contribute experience
points toward the creation of a magic item.
</p>
<p>
For example, Kroh has 1,000 gp and a masterwork sword, and wants to help
Klamzo imbue the sword with a +1 enhancement bonus (turning it
into a +1 longsword). This task would normally cost 200 craft points.
Klamzo must supply at least half of this, or 100. Kroh doesn't have <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft
Magic Arms and Armor</a>, so he must spend twice as many craft points to
achieve the same contribution. Assuming he's the only assistant, he could
contribute up to half the effort required to achieve the goal (100 craft
points). Since his craft points only count for half value, he has to spend
200 craft points to contribute 100 points worth of value. When those 200
points are added to Klamzo's contribution, the gold pieces spent on
materials, and the masterwork longsword, the process is complete.
</p>
<p>
If Freeble (also untrained) assisted Klamzo as well, the two assistants
combined could still contribute no more than the equivalent of 100 craft
points (half the total craft point cost). However, each would have to
spend only 100 craft points (50 points of value each) to achieve this
goal.
</p>
<h5><a id="gaining-craft-points"></a>
GAINING CRAFT POINTS
</h5>
A 1st-level character has 100 craft points. With each class level gained,
he gains a number of craft points equal to his new level � 100. A
2nd-level character can have as many as 300 craft points, and so forth,
all the way up to a 20th-level character, who would have a total of 21,000
craft points (assuming he never spent any).
<p>
Creatures with Intelligence of 3 or higher have craft points as a
character whose level equals their class levels + Hit Dice. A <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersMtoN.html#night-hag">night nag</a> (8 HD), for instance, has the
craft points of an 8th-level character. If that night nag gained a class level, it would
gain an additional 900 craft points. Of course, not all creatures can use
their craft points � despite being at least reasonably intelligent, a
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersG.html#griffon">griffon</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersOtoR.html#pegasus">pegasus</a> is unlikely to be in a position to craft an item or
assist another character in crafting an item. The Game Master must use his
best judgment when determining whether a creature can use its craft
points.
</p>
<p>
Creatures with Intelligence of 2 or lower (or without an Intelligence
score) never gain craft points.
</p>
<p>
Familiars or special mounts never gain craft points, regardless of their
intelligence or Hit Dice.

ITEM CRATION FEATS
</h5>
Each time you gain an item creation feat, you gain additional craft points
as noted on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-item-creation-feats">Table: Item Creation Feats</a>. You don't have to spend these
craft points on items appropriate to the feat - you can spend them on any
item. For example, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#craft-masterwork-weapon">Craft Masterwork Weapon</a> grants a bonus of 100 craft
points, which you can use to craft weapons, armor, potions, or any other
item.
<p>
In addition to the standard item creation feats, this variant includes a
number of feats dedicated to the creation of nonmagic items. <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-item-creation-feats">Table: Item
Creation Feats</a> gives appropriate new prerequisites for all item creation
