Some places and items are so evil that exposure to them marks, or taints,
a character in a very real and difficult-to-cleanse way. Taint is evil. It
is a corruption so deep it warps the very plane of reality. A weapon used
to slaughter thousands of innocents, a forest grown on land soaked in the
blood of an evil deity, a book bound in the flesh of an archfiend for his
own horrible purposes, and the presence of an evil deity are all sources
of taint. Then, of course, there are rings�
<h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-taint"></a>
BEHIND THE CURTAIN: TAINT
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">Taint can be added to campaigns fairly seamlessly. It�s generally best to
limit the number of places and items that can impart taint, to reduce the
bookkeeping load on players and the GM.
<p>
Taint makes evil a physical threat to the well-being of characters. It can
have a lasting impact on characters, even killing those who remain exposed
too long.
</p></div>
<h5><a id="taint-and-alignment"></a>
TAINT AND ALIGNMENT
</h5>
One way of using this variant system is to replace alignment with taint.
As a way of describing characters, taint works somewhat differently, since
the standard alignment system uses sets of opposites (law vs. chaos, good
vs. evil) and taint has no opposite. You�re either tainted, or you�re not.
<p>
In such a system, tainted characters are �evil,� considered a threat to
common people and, in sufficient numbers, to entire nations. Characters
without taint may act altruistically or selfishly, kindly or cruelly,
generously or miserly, as their personalities dictate. An evil monster has
a taint score equal to one-half its Charisma score, with evil undead
getting a +1 modifier and evil outsiders a +2 modifier.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, taint can be used in addition to alignment. While
characters with a minor amount of taint aren�t necessarily evil, they
probably are. The more taint they acquire, the more evil they become. The
GM should monitor taint carefully and provide a warning when a character
disregards its effect, just as he would when a character acts outside his
alignment.
</p>
<p>
If you include taint in your campaign, you can add a detect taint spell to
the cleric�s spell list. If you are not using alignment, change the
paladin�s detect evil ability to detect taint.
</p>
<p>
The detect taint spell or spell-like ability is identical to <a style="color: #579eb5" href="spellsDtoE.html#detect-evil">detect evil</a>,
except that it detects the presence of taint within a creature or object.
When determining the power of a tainted aura, refer to the table in the
detect evil spell description. Find the creature or object�s taint score
on the row for �Cleric of an evil deity�; the aura�s power corresponds to
the column in which the taint score is contained.
</p>
<h5><a id="becoming-tainted"></a>
BECOMING TAINTED
</h5>
Initial exposure to a tainted place or tainted object gives a character
1d3 points of taint.
<p>
For every 24 hours spent in a tainted place, or spent carrying a tainted
object, a character must make a Fortitude saving throw. The base DC is 10,
+5 for every consecutive 24 hours of exposure. Multiple simultaneous
exposures (such as carrying a tainted weapon in a tainted place) increase
the DC by +5 per source of exposure every 24 hours. If the character fails
his saving throw, his taint score increases by 1.
</p>
<p>
Because of their good Fortitude saves, most <a style="color: #579eb5" href="barbarian.html">barbarians</a>, <a style="color: #579eb5" href="fighter.html">fighters</a>, <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monk.html">monks</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb5" href="paladin.html">paladins</a>, and <a style="color: #579eb5" href="ranger.html">rangers</a> resist taint better than members of other classes.
<a style="color: #579eb5" href="bard.html">Bards</a>, <a style="color: #579eb5" href="rogue.html">rogues</a>, <a style="color: #579eb5" href="sorcerer.html">sorcerers</a>, and <a style="color: #579eb5" href="wizard.html">wizards</a> are much more susceptible to taint.
</p>
<h6><a id="taint-absorbing-items"></a>
Taint-Absorbing Items
</h6>
Some natural substances absorb taint and thus protect those who are
exposed to carry them. Examples include a pure jade rod the size of a
human finger, a sheet of vellum prepared from a year-old lamb, an
intricately carved piece of lightning-struck oak, or a silk sash. The GM
can create other examples appropriate to the campaign as well. Regardless
of the shape or substance of the item, taint-absorbing items cost 100 gp
each.
<p>
As an item absorbs taint, it darkens, softens, and gradually rots away
over seven days. During that time, it absorbs all taint to which the
carrier is exposed. Possessing multiple taint-absorbing items at the same
time can protect a character for longer than seven days, but the benefit
does not accumulate indefinitely, as shown on <a style="color: #579eb5" href="#table-taint-absorbing-items">Table: Taint-Absorbing
Items</a>.

<h6><a id="evil-and-taint"></a>
Evil and Taint
</h6>
Simply having an evil alignment is no defense against taint � it is too
profound an effect for personal beliefs or moral codes to ward it off.
Only <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monsterTypes.html#undead">undead</a> and creatures with the <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monsterTypes.html#evil">evil subtype</a> can ignore taint.
<p>
Of course, you may choose for evil creatures to become tainted by good.
You can create sacred places and objects in your campaign that taint evil
characters as well. You could say that creatures with the <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monsterTypes.html#good">good subtype</a> are
immune to the effects of taint in such sacred places, but those sacred
places would rot away creatures of the <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monsterTypes.html#evil">evil subtype</a>.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you could inflict taint according to the conflict between
law and chaos, along with or instead of taint associated with the
good-vs.-evil conflict.
</p>
<h6><a id="alternative-saving-throws"></a>
Alternative Saving Throws
</h6>
Often, fantasy literature portrays characters who delve into ancient,
lost, or forbidden knowledge as becoming warped by their exposure to such
knowledge. In campaigns with the same conceit, the Fortitude saving throw
makes sense. However, you could easily use a Will saving throw instead to
determine whether a character picks up taint. This would mean that <a style="color: #579eb5" href="bard.html">bards</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb5" href="cleric.html">clerics</a>, <a style="color: #579eb5" href="sorcerer.html">sorcerers</a>, and <a style="color: #579eb5" href="wizard.html">wizards</a> develop a resistance to taint as they go
up in levels (because of their good Will saves), but other classes would
have a much harder time resisting.
<p>
Whether a Fortitude save or a Will save is used, <a style="color: #579eb5" href="cleric.html">clerics</a>, <a style="color: #579eb5" href="druid.html">druids</a>, and
<a style="color: #579eb5" href="monk.html">monks</a> are equally resistant to taint, which supports the genre conceit of
horrible secrets hidden in inaccessible temples and monasteries. <a style="color: #579eb5" href="rogue.html">Rogues</a>
are vulnerable either way, explaining how thieves often appear in the
genre as unwittingly releasing horror on the world when they steal
something that was better left lost and protected.
</p>
<h5><a id="tainted-places"></a>
TAINTED PLACES
</h5>
When a character casts an evil spell in a tainted area, treat the caster
as +1 caster level for spell effects that depend on caster level. When a
character casts a good spell in a tainted area, treat the caster as -1
caster level for spell effects that depend on caster level. These changes
in caster level have no effect on spells known, spells per day, or highest
level of spell available.
<p>
If you are using Manual of the Planes, entire planes may inflict taint.
Mildly aligned planes inflict taint as outlined in <a style="color: #579eb5" href="#becoming-tainted">Becoming Tainted</a>.
On strongly aligned planes, the saving throw DC increases by +5
every 12 hours instead of every 24 hours.

<p>
A character�s taint score applies as a penalty to his Constitution and
Wisdom scores. Thus a character with a 16 Constitution and a 14 Wisdom who
acquires a taint score of 4 has an effective Constitution of 12 and an
effective Wisdom of 10. These penalties reflect the taint�s impact on the
character�s physical and mental health.
</p>
<p>
Characters who embrace taint (see below) and make use of it can ignore
some of these penalties. Though it reduces ability scores, the effect of
taint is not treated as <a style="color: #579eb5" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#ability-damage">ability damage</a>, <a style="color: #579eb5" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#ability-drain">ability drain</a>, or any other
penalty to an ability score that can be removed by magic.
</p>
<p>
A tainted character experiences the Constitution and Wisdom penalties in a
variety of ways, from mild nausea, joint pain, or disorientation to
rotting flesh, severe skeletal warping, and irresistible murderous urges.
<a style="color: #579eb5" href="#table-taint-effects">Table: Taint Effects</a> is categorized according to whether a character is
mildly, moderately, or severely tainted. A character who has lost 25% of
his Constitution to taint is mildly tainted. A character who has lost 50%
of his Constitution to taint is moderately tainted. A character who has
lost 75% of his Constitution to taint is severely tainted. The effects on
Table: Taint Effects are primarily meant as role-playing features, though
the GM can apply minor game-related modifiers to represent some of these
effects if he so chooses.
</p>
<p>
If a character�s Constitution score reaches 0 from the effects of taint,
he dies � and 1d6 hours later he rises as a hideous, evil creature under the
control of the GM. What sort of creature he becomes depends on his
character level before dying.

As terrible as the effects of taint are upon the living, they are even
worse upon the dead. Any creature that dies while exposed to taint
animates in 1d4 hours as an undead creature, usually a <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monstersTtoZ.html#zombie">zombie</a> of the
appropriate size. Burning a corpse protects it from this effect.
</p>
<h6><a id="embracing-taint"></a>
Embracing Taint
</h6>
Once a character�s taint score reaches 10 (assuming he is still alive), he
may seek out forces of great evil and pledge himself to their cause. Often
evil cults, temples of evil deities, and the militaries of evil warlords
eagerly accept such pledges, giving the character access to new sources of
power (see <a style="color: #579eb5" href="#tainted-prestige-classes">Tainted Prestige Classes</a>).
<h5><a id="cleansing-taint"></a>
CLEANSING TAINT
</h5>
It is possible to remove taint from characters in several ways, including
through the use of spells, the performance of good deeds, and cleansing in
a sacred spring. Taint cannot be removed unless the tainted character
wants to be cleansed.
<h6><a id="cleansing-with-spells"></a>
Spells
</h6>
The following spells can reduce taint scores when cast outside tainted
areas. No character can have his taint score reduced by any particular
spell more than once per day (though different spells can reduce taint if
cast on the same character in the same day).
<p><a id="cleansing-with-atonement"></a><b><a style="color: black" href="spellsAtoB.html#atonement">Atonement</a>:</b> This spell can remove taint, but with limits. First, it always requires a
quest. Second, the caster decides how much taint to remove when casting
atonement, up to a maximum equal to the caster�s level. This use of
atonement costs the caster 500 XP. Atonement can reduce a taint score to
0.
</p>
<p><a id="cleansing-with-heal"></a><b><a style="color: black" href="spellsHtoL.html#heal">Heal</a>:</b> This spell reduces a character�s taint score by 1 point per three caster
levels, but it cannot reduce a taint score below 1.
</p>
<p><a id="cleansing-with-miracle-or-wish"></a><b><a style="color: black" href="spellsMtoO.html#miracle">Miracle</a>, <a style="color: black" href="spellsTtoZ.html#wish">Wish</a>:</b> These spells cannot remove taint except by duplicating the effects of
other spells mentioned here.
</p>
<p><a id="cleansing-with-remove-curse-or-remove-disease"></a><b><a style="color: black" href="spellsPtor.html#remove-curse">Remove curse</a>, <a style="color: black" href="spellsPtoR.html#remove-disease">remove disease</a>:</b>
These spells reduce a character�s taint score by 1 point, but they cannot
reduce a taint score below 1.
</p>
<p><a id="cleansing-with-restoration"></a><b><a style="color: black" href="spellsPtoR.html#restoration">Restoration</a>:</b> This spell reduces a character�s taint score by 1 point per four caster
levels, but it cannot reduce a taint score below 1.
</p>
<p><a id="cleansing-with-greater-restoration"></a><b><a style="color: black" href="spellsPtoR.html#greater-restoration">Greater Restoration</a>:</b>
This spell reduces a character�s taint score by a number of points equal
to the caster level of the cleric casting greater restoration. Greater
restoration can reduce a taint score to 0.
</p>
<h6><a id="good-deeds"></a>
Good Deeds
</h6>
Simple good deeds are not enough to remove taint. A character wishing to
reduce his taint score through good deeds must undertake a particular
ritual under the guidance of one of his deity�s clerics. The ritual
prepares the character to undertake the deed.
<p>
Each deity�s faith has a list of ritual good deeds that the faithful may
perform to prove their dedication to their deity. For example, church
followers may choose to put on garments sacred to their faith (and which
identify their faith to anyone who sees them) and patrol a particular part
of their home as part of the militia or city guard. Adventuring is never
part of a good deed, and a character who undertakes an adventure prior to
completing his good deed must begin again with the ritual.
</p>
<p>
Deeds must be repeated every day for a week. Upon completion, the
character�s taint score is reduced by 1 point. The character may continue
the deed for another week to continue losing taint, or may return to the
temple to undertake the ritual again and begin a different deed.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, deeds may be quests undertaken on behalf of the deity.
After the quest ends, the character�s taint score is reduced by 1 point
per week required to complete the quest.
</p>
<p>
Good deeds may reduce a character�s taint score to 0.
</p>
<h6><a id="sacred-spring"></a>
Sacred Spring
</h6>
Springs sacred to a particular deity or cause are located in remote
regions, requiring long and dangerous travel to reach. For each day a
character spends resting and cleansing himself at a sacred spring, his
taint score is reduced by 1 point. A characters using this method to
reduce his taint score can undertake no activities other than resting,
eating, sleeping, and normal conversation.
<p>
Cleansing at a sacred spring may reduce a character�s taint score to 0.
</p>
<h6><a id="cleansing-places-and-objects"></a>
Cleansing Places and Objects
</h6>
Clerics may use <a style="color: #579eb5" href="spellsHtoL.html#hallow">hallow</a> to remove taint from an area, but it takes time.
The spell must remain intact for a year and a day to remove the taint from
the area. If, during that time, an opposing character casts <a style="color: #579eb5" href="spellsTtoZ.html#unhallow">unhallow</a> on
some or all of the area, the effort is lost and must be reinstated by
another casting of hallow. (The hallow spell only affects a 40-foot-radius
area, so large areas may require many clerics working simultaneously to
completely guard them.)
<p>
Unintelligent items left in a hallowed area for a year and a day lose
their taint. Items that have an Intelligence score (and are thus treated
as constructs for this purpose) can only be cleansed by using the spells
mentioned above.

Tainted sorcerers find an easy path to tremendous magical power. Young
wizards frustrated at the slow pace of their studies, old scholars chafing
at the limitations of traditional magic, peasant folk-magic practitioners,

succumb to taint � for all these spellcasters, taint offers a way to
overcome obstacles that the sanctioned magic of the world cannot provide.

NPC tainted sorcerers are everywhere, though they usually hide very
carefully.

</p>
<p><b>Base Will Save:</b> +4.

<p><b>Spells:</b> Ability to cast 1st-level spells.
</p>
<p><b>Taint:</b> Character�s taint score must be 4 or higher.
</p>
<p><b>Special:</b> Must have learned the basics of taint magic from a tainted sorcerer of at
least 4th level, or must have summoned a demon or devil to gain
instruction.
</p>
<h6><a id="tainted-sorcerer-class-skills"></a>
Class Skills
</h6>
The tainted sorcerer�s class skills (and the key ability for each skill)
are <a style="color: #579eb5" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a> (Cha), <a style="color: #579eb5" href="skillsAll.html#concentration">Concentration</a> (Con), <a style="color: #579eb5" href="skillsAll.html#disguise">Disguise</a> (Cha), <a style="color: #579eb5" href="skillsAll.html#hide">Hide</a> (Dex),

(Int).
<p><b>Skill Points at Each Level:</b> 2 + Int modifier
</p>
<h6><a id="tainted-sorcerer-class-features"></a>
Class Features
</h6>
The following are class features of the tainted sorcerer.
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Tainted sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not
proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes
with a tainted sorcerer�s arcane gestures, which can cause her spells to
fail (if those spells have somatic components).
</p>
<p><b>Spells per Day/ Spells Known:</b>When a new tainted sorcerer level is gained, the character gains new
spells known and spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a
spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class.
She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class
would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of
tainted sorcerer to the level of whatever other spellcasting class she
has, then determines spells known, spells per day, and caster level
accordingly.

<p>
A tainted sorcerer must use blood in place of any spell�s material
component (if the spell has no material component, ignore this cost). She
has two choices for a source of blood: herself or someone else.
</p>
<p>
If she uses her own blood, the minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood
is a free action that becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Using
this ability deals 1 point of damage to the tainted sorcerer, but the
character does not need to make a <a style="color: #579eb5" href="skillsAll.html#concentration">Concentration</a> check to successfully cast
the spell, despite the wound.
</p>
<p>
Substituting blood for a costly material component requires drawing a
greater amount of blood. A tainted sorcerer deals more damage to herself
when drawing a large amount of blood, as shown on the table below. Also,
when using blood to replace a costly component in this way, the tainted
sorcerer must make a <a style="color: #579eb5" href="skillsAll.html#concentration">Concentration</a> check (DC 10 + damage taken + spell
level) to successfully cast the spell.
</p>
<p>
If the tainted sorcerer draws someone else�s blood to use as a material
component, the rules given above generally apply. If the source of blood
is willing (or helpless) and is adjacent to the tainted sorcerer, she can
make a minor knife cut to obtain a small amount of blood as a free action
during the casting of the spell. (If the source is not willing or helpless
and not adjacent, how long it takes to draw blood depends entirely on the
circumstances.)
</p>
<p>
No single source of blood can be used to replace a costly material
component unless the character or creature�s current hit point total is
high enough to absorb all the damage without falling below -10. For
example, the blood of an orc with 6 hit points remaining is not sufficient
to replace a component that costs 301 gp or more, because the orc cannot
take the necessary 17 points of damage before it is dead.
</p>
<p><a id="tainted-sorcerer-taint-suppression"></a><b>Taint Suppression:</b>
While a tainted sorcerer is likely to accumulate a high taint score over
the course of her life, this taint is not immediately obvious to
onlookers. A tainted sorcerer�s taint manifests in mental
effects � insanity, rage, and nightmares � and in internal physical effects.
If a tainted sorcerer is split open, the character�s internal corruption
is obvious: Her body is full of bloody pus and strange growths, even
internal limbs. If a tainted sorcerer enters a tainted area, her
corruption immediately manifests externally as well. Barring these two
conditions, it is impossible to detect a tainted sorcerer based on
appearance.
</p>
<p>
A tainted sorcerer no longer applies her taint score as a penalty to her
Constitution, and only applies one-half her taint score as a penalty to
her Wisdom.
</p>
<p><a id="tainted-sorcerer-tainted-magic"></a><b>Tainted Metamagic:</b>
A tainted sorcerer who learns metamagic feats can apply them by paying an
additional cost in blood. By draining blood, a tainted sorcerer can
enhance her spells without using a higher-level spell slot. The cost is a
number of points of <a style="color: #579eb5" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#ability-damage">Constitution damage</a> equal to the spell slot adjustment
of the metamagic feat. Thus, casting an <a style="color: #579eb5" href="featsAll.html#empower-spell">empowered</a> <a style="color: #579eb5" href="spellsTtoZ.html#vampiric-touch">vampiric touch</a> spell
costs a tainted sorcerer 2 points of Constitution damage, because an
empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than normal. A
tainted sorcerer cannot enhance a spell to a level higher than she can
cast by this means. For example, a tainted sorcerer must be at least a
9th-level caster to cast an empowered vampiric touch spell (or at least
10th level, if the character is casting as a <a style="color: #579eb5" href="sorcerer.html">sorcerer</a>), since the
empowered spell requires a 5th-level spell slot.
</p>
<p>
A tainted sorcerer without a Constitution score cannot use this ability.
</p>
<p><a id="tainted-sorcerer-tainted-spellcasting"></a><b>Tainted Spellcasting (Su):</b>
Rather than using a key ability score for spellcasting, a tainted sorcerer
uses her taint score. To cast a spell, a tainted sorcerer must have a
taint score at least equal to the spell�s level. Tainted sorcerer bonus
spells are based on a number equal to the character�s taint score + 10,
and saving throws against tainted sorcerer spells have a DC of 10 + spell
level + the tainted sorcerer�s taint score.
</p>
<p>
A tainted sorcerer accumulates taint for casting her spells. All spells a
tainted sorcerer casts are evil spells. She must make a Fortitude save (DC
10 + spell level) or increase her taint score by 1.
</p>
<p><a id="tainted-sorcerer-level-advancement"></a><b>Level Advancement:</b>
The power of taint is seductive. Once a character has tasted its
attractions, it is hard to resist. Whenever a tainted sorcerer gains a new
level and wishes to advance a level in some other class, she must succeed
on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + taint score). If she fails the saving
throw, she must advance her tainted sorcerer level. If she succeeds on
this saving throw, she can advance a level in some other class.

When a character�s taint threatens to exceed the capacity of his body and
soul to contain it, he may become possessed by its evil power and
transformed into a creature of taint. Such characters feel an irresistible
urge to travel to regions of taint, often walking until their feet bleed,
slaughtering anyone in the way. The lucky ones are killed by adventurers,
militias, or monsters. The unlucky ones are guided by evil cults and
become transformed into living servants of evil.
</p>
<p>
Most tainted warriors were barbarians, fighters, or rangers before their
taint overcame them, although a member of any race or character class can
adopt this prestige class. Clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards are
usually seduced by the <a style="color: #579eb5" href="#tainted-sorcerer">tainted sorcerer</a> class instead.
</p>
<p>
NPC tainted warriors are found near regions of taint, often serving as
commanders for small groups of evil humanoids.

Class Features
</h6>
The following are class features of the tainted warrior.
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Tainted warriors do not gain any additional weapon or armor proficiencies.
</p>
<p><b><a id="tainted-warrior-taint-suppression"></a>Taint Suppression:</b>
By definition, a tainted warrior is overwhelmed with taint, but this taint
is not immediately obvious to onlookers. A tainted warrior�s taint
manifests in mental effects � delirium, anger, and cruelty � and in internal
physical effects. If a tainted warrior is split open, the internal
corruption is obvious: His body is full of vile liquids and distorted
growths, even internal limbs. If a tainted warrior enters a tainted area,
his corruption immediately manifests externally as well. Barring these two
conditions, it is impossible to detect a tainted warrior based on
appearance.
</p>
<p>
A tainted warrior no longer applies his taint score as a penalty to his
Constitution, and only applies one-half his taint score as a penalty to
his Wisdom.
</p>
<p><b><a id="tainted-warrior-damage-reduction"></a>Damage Reduction (Ex):</b>
At 2nd level, a tainted warrior gains <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monsterTypes.html#DR">damage reduction</a> 1/good. The value
of the character�s damage reduction increases by 1 point at every
even-numbered level thereafter.
</p>
<p><b><a id="tainted-warrior-tainted-strike"></a>Tainted Strike (Ex):</b>
A tainted warrior of 3rd level or higher can infuse a melee attack with
the power of his taint. The character adds his taint score to the damage
dealt by the melee attack, and the target�s taint score increases by 1.
</p>
<p>
If a tainted warrior strikes a creature immune to the effects of taint
(such as an <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monsterTypes.html#undead">undead creature</a> or a creature with the <a style="color: #579eb5" href="monsterTypes.html#evil">evil subtype</a>), the
tainted strike has no effect.
</p>
<p>
A tainted warrior can use this ability once per day upon attaining 3rd
level and one additional time per day for every four levels gained
thereafter.
