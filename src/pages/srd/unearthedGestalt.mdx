In this high-powered campaign variant, characters essentially take
two classes at every level, choosing the best aspects of each. The
process is similar to multiclassing, except that characters gain the
full benefits of each class at each level. if the two classes you
choose have aspects that overlap (such as Hit Dice, attack
progression, saves, and class features common to more than one
class), you choose the better aspect. The gestalt character retains
all aspects that don&rsquo;t overlap.
<p>The gestalt character variant is particularly effective if you
have three or fewer players in your group, or if your players enjoy
multiclassing and want characters with truly prodigious powers. This
variant works only if every PC in the campaign uses it, and it
results in complicated characters who may overwhelm newer players
with an abundance of options.</p>
<h4><a id="building-gestalt-characters"></a> Building Gestalt
Characters</h4>
<p>To make a 1st-level gestalt character, choose two <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="classes.html">standard classes</a>.
(You can also choose any of the variant classes in this book, though
you can't combine two versions of the same class.) Build your
character according to the following guidelines.</p>
<h6><a id="gestalt-hit-dice"></a> Hit
Dice</h6>
Choose the larger Hit Die. A monk/sorcerer would use d8 as her Hit
Die and have 8 hit points (plus Constitution modifier) at 1st level,
for example.
<h6><a id="gestalt-base-attack-bonus"></a> Base Attack Bonus</h6>
Choose the better progression from the two classes.
<h6><a
id="gestalt-base-saving-throw-bonuses"></a> Base Saving Throw
Bonuses</h6>
For each save bonus, choose the better progression from the two
classes. For example, a 1st-level gestalt fighter/wizard would have
base saving throw bonuses of Fortitude +2, Reflex +0, Will +2
&mdash; taking the good Fortitude save from the fighter class and
the good Will save from the wizard class.
<h6><a id="gestalt-class-skills-"></a>
Class Skills</h6>
Take the number of skill points gained per level from whichever
class grants more skill points, and consider any skill on either
class list as a class skill for the gestalt character. For example,
a gestalt barbarian/bard would gain skill points per level equal to
6 + Int modifier (and have four times this amount at 1st level), and
can purchase skills from both the barbarian and bard lists as class
skills.
<h6><a id="gestalt-class-features"></a> Class Features</h6>
A gestalt character gains the class features of both classes. A
1st-level gestalt rogue/cleric, for example, gets <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="rogue.html#rogue-sneak-attack">sneak
attack</a> +1d6, <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="rogue.html#rogue-trapfinding">trapfinding</a>, 1st-level <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="cleric.html#cleric-spells">cleric
spells</a>, and the ability to <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="cleric.html#cleric-turn-or-rebuke-undead">turn or rebuke
undead</a>. Class- and ability-based restrictions (such as arcane
spell failure chance and a druid's prohibition on wearing metal
armor) apply normally to a gestalt character, no matter what the
other class is.
<p>A gestalt character follows a similar procedure when he attains
2nd and subsequent levels. Each time he gains a new level, he
chooses two classes, takes the best aspects of each, and applies
them to his characteristics. A few caveats apply, however.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class features that two classes share (such as <a
style="color: #579eb6"
href="barbarian.html#barbarian-uncanny-dodge">uncanny dodge</a>)
accrue at the rate of the faster class.</li>
<li>Gestalt characters with more than one spellcasting class keep
track of their spells per day separately.</li>
<li>A gestalt character can't combine two prestige classes at any
level, although it's okay to combine a prestige class and a
regular class. Prestige classes that are essentially class
combinations - such as the <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="arcaneTrickster.html">arcane trickster</a>, <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="mysticTheurge.html">mystic
theurge</a>, and <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="eldritchKnight.html">eldritch knight</a> - should be
prohibited if you&rsquo;re using gestalt classes, because they
unduly complicate the game balance of what&rsquo;s already a
high-powered variant. Because it&rsquo;s possible for gestalt
characters to qualify for prestige classes earlier than normal,
the game master is entirely justified in toughening the
prerequisites of a prestige class so it's available only after 5th
level, even for gestalt characters.</li>
</ul>
<h5><a id="gestalt-combinations"></a>
GESTALT COMBINATIONS</h5>
Because the player of a gestalt character chooses two classes at
every level, the possibilities for gestalt characters are almost
limitless. The following combinations are particularly potent.
<h6><a id="barbarian-bard"></a>
Barbarian/Bard</h6>
The "barbarian" has two choices in a battle: use a mix of
party-aiding spells and attacks, or rage and use inspirational music
to urge the rest of the party on as he attacks. Only the bardic
music abilities that actually require a <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> check (such as countersong
and fascinate) are off limits during a rage. Neither barbarians nor
bards wear heavy armor, so gear selection is straightforward.
<h6><a id="barbarian-wizard"></a>
Barbarian/Wizard</h6>
The barbarian brings that d12 Hit Die to the table, and that&rsquo;s
almost all that matters to the fragile wizard. A good Fortitude save
is sure to save the gestalt character's hide a few times, and a
high-Intelligence character benefits greatly from the union of two
disparate class skill lists. And as a bonus, you're literate at 1st
level. The only downside? You can't cast spells in a rage. This
combination deliberately tweaks the stereotypes of both classes, so
you'll want to spend some time thinking about your character's
backstory.
<h6><a id="cleric-sorcerer"></a>
Cleric/Sorcerer</h6>
This gestalt combination is effectively the mystic theurge prestige
class on steroids. You can load up on combat spells as a sorcerer,
then prepare utility and protective spells as a cleric - which you
can always spontaneously cast as healing spells if you like. As a
side benefit, your high Charisma helps both your arcane spellcasting
and your ability to turn undead.
<h6><a id="druid-ranger"></a> Druid/Ranger</h6>
With the ranger's base attack bonus, you'll be a more effective
combatant when you wild shape into a predator. The extra skills of a
ranger are welcome, and if you choose the archery combat style,
you'll be ready for both ranged combat and an up-close fight in wild
shape form.
<h6><a id="fighter-ranger"></a>
Fighter/Ranger</h6>
If you like feats, this is the class for you. Most fighters must
choose whether to split their feats between melee and ranged combat
or emphasize one kind of attack at the expense of the other. The
fighter/ranger can have it both ways, relying on the fighter bonus
feats to improve melee attacks and the ranger's combat style,
improved combat style, and combat style mastery to pick up three
good archery feats.
<h6><a id="fighter-rogue"></a>
Fighter/Rogue</h6>
Every rogue likes to get behind the enemy and dish out sneak attack
damage. With this gestalt combination, that trick gets even better
because you have the hit points and Armor Class to survive
toe-to-toe with the enemy, you'll hit more often, and you get more
attacks, which just means more chances to pick up a fistful of d6s.
You can wear heavy armor, but you'll degrade some of your better
skills and you'll lose access to evasion.
<h6><a id="monk-cleric"></a> Monk/Cleric</h6>
You'll probably give up your armor, but you can run around the
battlefield in a blur, healing your comrades and putting the hurt on
the bad guys with such combinations as stunning fist with an <a
style="color: #579eb6"
href="spellsHtoL.html#inflict-serious-wounds">inflict serious
wounds</a> spell attached. Once you draw up your new character, note
how many great cleric spells have a range of touch. The same Wisdom
score that drives your spellcasting also improves your Armor Class.
<h6><a id="monk-sorcerer"></a> Monk/Sorcerer
and Monk/Wizard</h6>
With three good saves, more hit points, and the best unarmored Armor
Class, the monk covers up many of the weak points of the sorcerer or
wizard. The only downside is that the important ability scores for
sorcerers and wizards &mdash; Charisma and Intelligence &mdash; are
the two ability scores that the monk cares least about. This can be
a tough combination to pull off, especially if you&rsquo;re using
point-based ability score generation.
<h6><a id="paladin-sorcerer"></a>
Paladin/Sorcerer</h6>
Charisma does the heavy lifting for this gestalt combination. Why?
Two words: divine grace. Like all sorcerers, you'll send your
Charisma score into the stratosphere with the every-four-levels
improvement and the best cloak of Charisma you can afford. Every
time you get more spells, your saving throws improve as well. The
downside? You can't wear armor like most paladins.
<h6><a id="sorcerer-wizard"></a>
Sorcerer/Wizard</h6>
Unlike most gestalt characters, your hit points, Armor Class, base
attack bonus, and saving throws aren't any better than a standard
sorcerer or wizard. But oh, the spells you can cast! Unlike a
standard arcane spellcaster, you can afford to use your
highest-level spells in most of your serious fights. It's a good
idea to use your sorcerer slots on combat spells (such as the
ubiquitous <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="spellsFtoG.html#fireball">fireball</a>) and the occasional
defense or utility spell (perhaps <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="spellsMtoO.html#mage-armor">mage armor</a> or <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#haste">haste</a>). Then
you can use your wizard slots for spells that are great against
specific foes (such as <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="spellsDtoE.html#dimissal">dismissal</a>) or life-savers in
specific situations (<a style="color: #579eb6"
href="spellsFtoG.html#gaseous-form">gaseous form</a>). You can
gamble a little more with your wizard spell selection because you
know you have all those useful sorcerer spells backing you up.
<h4><a id="balancing-gestalt-characters"></a> Balancing Gestalt
Characters</h4>
Obviously, this variant results in characters who are significantly
more powerful than is standard. But how much more powerful? The
simple answer - that gestalt characters are twice as powerful as
standard characters &mdash; isn't accurate. Gestalt characters don't
have an advantage in the most important game currency: available
actions. Even a character who can fight like a barbarian and cast
spells like a sorcerer can't do both in the same round. A gestalt
character can't be in two places at once as two separate characters
can be. Gestalt characters who try to fulfill two party roles (melee
fighter and spellcaster, for example) find they must split their
feat choices, ability score improvements, and gear selection between
their two functions.
<p>While a gestalt character isn't as powerful as two characters of
equal level, a gestalt character is more powerful than a standard
character. Hit points will always be at least equal to those of a
standard character, saving throws will almost certainly be better,
and gestalt characters have versatility that standard characters
can't achieve without multiclassing. Furthermore, a party of gestalt
characters has greater durability and many more spells per day, so
they can often take on six or more consecutive encounters without
stopping to rest and prepare more spells.</p>
<p>Your players may be excited by the chance to play fighters with
powerful sneak attacks or spellcasters who can cast any spell. But
as the game master, you know that the only measure of PC power that
matters is the comparison with NPC power. By throwing monsters of
higher Challenge Ratings at them, you'll still be giving them
significant challenges. Gestalt characters look superior compared to
standard characters, but that's a false comparison. With this
variant, such "standard" characters don't exist.</p>
<p>Here's how to build a campaign that can handle gestalt
characters.</p>
<h6><a id="challenge-ratings"></a>
Challenge Ratings</h6>
Gestalt characters can obviously handle more opposition than
standard characters. The simplest way to compensate for this is to
use adventures with tougher monsters. In general, a party of four
gestalt characters can handle multiple encounters with a single
monster of a Challenge Rating equal to their average level + 1. If
the monster poses a challenge because it forces the characters to
succeed on life-threatening saving throws (such as with a <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersMtoN.html#medusa">medusa</a> or
a <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="monstersTtoZ.html#wyvern">wyvern</a>), it's even weaker
against gestalt characters, who have few or no weak saves.
Characters can handle multiple encounters with such monsters at a
Challenge Rating equal to their average level + 2. A <a
style="color: #579eb6"
href="monstersS.html#shambling-mound">shambling mound</a> (CR 6) or
a medusa (CR 7) would be appropriate average encounters for four
5th-level gestalt characters. If you take this approach, realize
that characters gain levels faster than in a typical campaign,
because they're gaining experience points as if those encounters
were harder than they actually are. You're obviously comfortable
with a high-powered game, so faster advancement may be an additional
benefit, not a problem. if you rely on published adventures, this is
the easiest option.
<p>If you want to keep level advancement at the standard average of
thirteen encounters per level, reduce the Challenge Ratings of all
the monsters and NPCs in your campaign by 1 (or by 2 if they rely on
failed PC saving throws to pose a challenge). The <a
style="color: #579eb6"
href="monstersS.html#shambling-mound">shambling mound</a> and the <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersMtoN.html#medusa">medusa</a>
would both become CR 5 monsters, and the gestalt characters gain
levels at the usual rate. Monsters with a Challenge Rating of 1
become CR 1/2, and other monsters with fractional Challenge Ratings
have their CRs cut in half (kobolds become CR 1/6, in other words).
Many staple low-CR monsters don't work well against a party of
gestalt characters, even 1st-level gestalts.</p>
<h6><a id="adventure-design"></a> Adventure
Design</h6>
Once you adjust the Challenge Ratings, you have one more subtle
factor to consider when you design adventures for gestalt
characters. You must take into account the greater "adventure
stamina" of gestalt characters both when you're preparing an
adventure and when you're at the gaming table running the adventure.
Because gestalt characters have more hit points, better saving
throws, and deeper spellcasting lists than standard characters, they
can safely tackle more encounters in a row before they run low on
hit points and spells.
<p>Gestalt characters can, for example, delve deeply into a dungeon
on their first foray, when the dungeon denizens may not be expecting
them. The defenders of any site in a site-based adventure can't rely
on wearing out a party of gestalt characters. They have to pose
enough of a threat that the gestalt characters retreat because
they're worried about their hides, not just because the wizard is
almost out of spells.</p>
<p>In event-based adventures, gestalt characters can wreak havoc
with timetables because they have more resources at their disposal.
For example, a 10th-level gestalt wizard/sorcerer can easily
teleport the entire party four times a day - without resorting to
scrolls. That means two round trips to visit the wizened sage who's
an expert in rune translation, each in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>At the gaming table, you may want to plan longer gaming sessions
because rest periods for the characters are natural stopping points
for the players, and gestalt characters have fewer rest periods. if
you do stop in the middle of the action, encourage your players to
take careful notes of which class abilities they expend, which
spells they have active, and other relevant information. Gestalt
characters are complex enough that relying solely on memory is a
recipe for trouble.</p>
<h6><a id="npcs"></a> NPCs</h6>
An important aspect of most campaigns is verisimilitude &mdash;
which is centered on the notion that everything in the campaign
world is obeying the same set of rules. Accordingly, any important
NPCs in your game should also be gestalt characters. It's probably
not necessary to have low-level noncombatant NPCs pick two classes,
but any NPCs above 1st level should be constructed as gestalt
characters. (NPCs with levels only in NPC classes - <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="npcClasses.html#adept">adept</a>, <a
style="color: #579eb6"
href="npcClasses.html#aristocrat">aristocrat</a>, <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="npcClasses.html#commoner">commoner</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="npcClasses.html#expert">expert</a>,
and <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="npcClasses.html#warrior">warrior</a> - can remain standard
characters.)
<h6><a id="prestige-classes"></a> Prestige
Classes</h6>
The high-powered nature of the gestalt character variant gives you
more room to create unique prestige classes. First, you can create
narrowly specialized prestige classes, and they'll still be
compelling choices for PCs because the characters can simultaneously
advance in a regular class while taking levels in the prestige
class. Players won't feel shoehorned into a very specific prestige
class if they have another class they're also advancing in. Second,
you can create truly outrageous prestige classes - but add the
additional cost that such classes take up both class choices for
gestalt characters. For example, a prestige class that offered a d12
Hit Die, +1/level base attack bonus, two good saves, full
spellcasting, and a host of class features would be completely
unbalanced in a standard game. But if it takes up both "class slots"
for a gestalt characters, it's no more powerful than taking a level
in the barbarian/wizard gestalt.
<h6><a id="campaign-pacing"></a> Campaign
Pacing</h6>
Once it is adjusted as outlined above, a campaign that employs
gestalt characters isn't that different from a standard campaign.
Gestalt characters don't gain access to key campaign-changing
abilities faster than their standard counterparts. No gestalt
character can use <a style="color: #579eb6"
href="spellsTtoZ.html#teleport">teleport</a> or <a
style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#raise-dead">raise the
dead</a> under her own power before 9th level, and no non-monk
gestalt character gets a second melee attack in a round before 6th
level. Gestalt characters get to tackle monsters a level or two
ahead of time, but they're still fighting gnolls at low levels,
purple worms at middle levels, and balors at high levels. Perhaps
the only noticeable difference in terms of campaign pacing is that
gestalt PCs are "something special" from the beginning. They are far
more powerful than typical 1st-level commoners even at the beginning
of the campaign. Again, this difference only matters for a level or
two, because standard 3rd level characters are also far more
powerful than 1st-level commoners.
