<b>Level:</b> Shaper 4

<b>Display:</b> Material; see text

<b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 round

<b>Range:</b> 0 ft.

<b>Effect:</b> 1-inch-diameter dollop of quintessence; see text

<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous

<b>Saving Throw:</b> None

<b>Power Resistance:</b> No

<b>Power Points:</b> 7

<p>You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a
1-ounce dollop
of thick, gooey material called quintessence. This substance shimmers
like a silver mirror when viewed from some angles but is transparent
from other viewpoints. You can smooth a dollop of quintessence around
any extremely small object.</p>
<p>Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the
effects of
time; in practical terms, they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh
with only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled
out of the time stream (the manifester is immune to this effect). This
disruption deals 1 point of damage per round beginning 10 rounds after
partial contact occurs.</p>
<p>Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected
object,
freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When you do this, there is a 75%
chance that the quintessence evaporates back into the continuum.
Otherwise, it coalesces again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available
for later use.</p>
<p>Large quantities of quintessence could theoretically be
gathered to
preserve large items or structures (or even a complete living creature;
if completely immersed, a living creature would not take the damage
associated with partial contact). However, psionic characters and
creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations of
quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity within a
5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers require twice as many power
points to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful DC 16 Will
save
each time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these
circumstances, manifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at will is
a full-round action rather than a standard action.</p>

<b>Level:</b> Telepath 2

<b>Area:</b> Cone-shaped emanation centered on you

<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

<b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates; see text

<b>Power Resistance:</b> No

<b>Power Points:</b> 3

<p>You know the surface thoughts of the mind of any creature in
the area
that fails a Will save. A target that succeeds on its save is not
affected by this manifestation of the power, even if it leaves the area
and then reenters the area before the duration expires.</p>
<p>Creatures of animal intelligence have simple, instinctual
thoughts that
you can pick up. If you read the thoughts of a creature with an
Intelligence of 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your
own Intelligence score), you are <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">stunned</a> for 1 round and the
power
ends. This power does not let you pinpoint the location of an affected
mind if you don&rsquo;t have line of sight to the subject.</p>
<p>Each round, you can turn to use this power in a new area. The
power can
penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin
sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>

farreaching effects. A reality
revision
can produce any one of the following effects. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Duplicate any <a href="PsionicPsionList.html"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">psion power</a> of 8th level or

the power
is not prohibited to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate any other power (but not a spell) of 6th level

such as a <a href="PsionicWarriorList.html"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">psychic warrior power</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate any psion power of 7th level or lower even if
it&rsquo;s a power
prohibited to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undo the harmful effects of many other powers, such as <a

href="spellsFtoG.html#geas-quest" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">geas/quest</a>,
or <a href="psionicPowersGtoP.html#insanity"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">insanity</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a nonpsionic item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a psionic item, or add to the powers of an existing
psionic
item (see XP cost below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score.
Two to five
reality revisions manifested in immediate succession can grant a
creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score. Inherent
bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be negated or dispelled. An
inherent bonus cannot exceed +5 for a single ability score. Inherent
bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack; only the best one
applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single reality revision
can aid
one creature per manifester level, and all subjects are cured of the
same kind of affliction.

Reality revision can not restore the experience point loss from
manifesting a power or casting a spell, or the level or&nbsp;
Constitution loss from being returned to life by those effects that
reduce level or Constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revive the dead. Reality revision can bring a dead
creature back to
life by duplicating a <a href="spellsPtoR.html#resurrection"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">resurrection</a> spell. This power
can revive a dead
creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two
manifestations of reality revision, one to recreate the body and
another to infuse the body with life again. Reality revision cannot
prevent a character who is brought back to life from losing a level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transport travelers. This power can lift one creature per
manifester
level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere
else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target
gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any)
applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undo misfortune. Reality revision can undo a single recent
event.
Manifesting the power forces a reroll of any roll made within the last
round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to
accommodate the new result. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or
worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to
negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can try to use reality revision to produce more powerful
effects
than these, but doing so is dangerous. The manifestation may pervert
your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a
partial fulfillment.</p>
<p>Duplicated powers allow saves and power resistance as normal
(but save
DCs are calculated as though the power is 9th level).</p>
<p><i>XP Cost:</i> The minimum XP cost for manifesting reality
revision is 5,000 XP. When a manifestation duplicates a power that has
an XP cost, you
must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a manifestation
creates or improves a psionic item, you must pay twice the normal XP
cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.</p>

<p>You send your mind across space and dimensions, forming it

located at any distance from you, even if planar boundaries separate
you. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the remote viewing attempt
fails, and you can&rsquo;t attempt to view that creature again for at
least
24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the
subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that
creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5
bonus on its Will save.</p>

<p>If the subject fails its Will save, your mind coalesces a
quasi-real
viewpoint near enough to the subject to see and hear the subject and
its immediate surroundings (up 30 feet in all directions away from the
subject).</p>
<p>While the remote viewing lasts, your real body remains
unmoving and
unaware of your actual surroundings. On the other hand, your quasi-real
viewpoint is treated in some ways as if it were an <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a>
ectoplasmic form of yourself, except as follows. This power is of the
Scrying subdiscipline, but use the following information in place of
the standard scrying sensor. As a quasi-real viewpoint, you can speak
(though your voice is whispery).</p>
<p>You may potentially be sensed by the subject of your viewing
(subjects
who can see or sense invisible or hidden creatures automatically sense
you; otherwise you make a <a href="skillsAll.html#hide"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Hide</a> check with a +40 bonus to
escape
detection if immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving). You could be attacked
(although if you become subject to <a
href="psionicPowersDtoF.html#dispel-psionics"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dispel psionics</a>, the remote
viewing
simply ends). If the subject moves, you can attempt to follow it at a
speed of 20 feet, though if it gets farther than 30 feet from you (or
you move farther than 30 feet from it), the power ends.</p>
<p>You can attempt to manifest one power through your quasi-real
viewpoint, but you must make a <a
href="psionicSkills.html#concentration"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Concentration</a> check (DC 20 +
level of
the power you wish to manifest) to succeed. Manifesting (or attempting
and failing to manifest) a power immediately ends the remote viewing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all powers from your quasi-real viewpoint cost
twice the
usual number of power points (you can&rsquo;t exceed the power point
limit
set by your manifester level, so you are restricted to manifesting
lower-level powers than you otherwise could). Power points you spend as
a quasireal viewpoint are drained from your real body.</p>

<p>You restore a severed extremity to a creature that has lost a

it returns a lost extremity to a living or dead creature if the

<b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)

<b>Power Points:</b> 7

<p>Your mind splits into two independent parts. Each part
functions in
complete autonomy, like two characters in one body. Your new
&ldquo;second
mind&rdquo; does not control your body physically but is free to take
one
standard action in each round if the action is purely mental (such as
manifesting a power) in the same round you take your normal actions.</p>
<p>Your second mind can manifest powers using your power point
reserve,
but only as if your manifester level were six lower than it is. Your
second mind doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity when
manifesting a
power, because doing so doesn&rsquo;t distract your primary mind.</p>
<p>Your second mind takes its first action on your turn in the
round after
schism is manifested.</p>
<p>Both your minds communicate with each other telepathically. If
you are
subject to a compulsion or charm effect while you are of two minds,
make a second saving throw if you fail the first. If you fail both,
then the schism ends and you are affected normally by the power. If you
fail just one, the schism ends immediately, but you are not subject to
the compulsion or charm.</p>

<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1min./level

<b>Power Points:</b> 1

<p>You perceive what the subject creature perceives using its
sight,
hearing, taste, or smell. Only one sense is linked, and you cannot
switch between senses with the same manifestation.</p>
<p>You make any skill checks involving senses, such as <a

the subject, and only within the subject&rsquo;s field of view. You
lose your
Dexterity bonus to AC while directly sensing what the subject senses.</p>
<p>Once sense link is manifested, the link persists even if the
subject
moves out of the range of the original manifestation (but the link does
not work across planes). You do not control the subject, nor can you
communicate with it by means of this power.</p>
<p>The strength of the subject&rsquo;s linked sense could be
enhanced
by other
powers or items, allowing you the same enhanced sense. You are subject

<p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or both of
the following
ways.</p>
<p>1. If you spend 2 additional power points, you can have the
subject
perceive one of your senses instead of the other way around.</p>

<p>Your body and all your equipment are subsumed by your shadow.
As a
living shadow, you blend perfectly into any other shadow and vanish in
darkness. You appear as an unattached shadow in areas of full light.</p>
<p>You can move at your normal speed, on any surface, including
walls and
ceilings, as well as across the surfaces of liquids - even up the face
of
a waterfall.</p>
<p>Your space does not change, so you cannot move into locations
you would
not normally be able to move into.</p>
<p>While in your shadow body, you gain <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#damage-reduction">damage
reduction</a> 10/magic

that read
thoughts, life, or presences (including <a href="#true-seeing-psionic"

suspicious movements in lighted areas.</p>
<p>You cannot harm anyone physically or manipulate any objects,
but you
can use your powers normally. Doing so may attract notice, but if you
remain in a shadowed area, you get a +15 bonus on your <a

<b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)

<b>Power Points:</b> 3

<p>This power creates a psychometabolic connection between you
and a
willing subject so that some of your wounds are transferred to the
subject. You take half damage from all attacks that deal hit point
damage to you, and the subject takes the remainder. The amount of
damage not taken by you is taken by the subject. If your hit points are
reduced by a lowered Constitution score, that reduction is not shared
with the subject because it is not a form of hit point damage. When
this power ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the
subject and you, but damage already shared is not reassigned.</p>
<p>If you and the subject move farther away from each other than
close
range, the power ends.</p>
<p>You can manifest this power on two willing subjects, one of
which you
designate to share its damage with the other.</p>

<b>Power Points:</b> 1

<p>You, another willing creature, or an unattended object can
slide along
solid ground as if on smooth ice. If you manifest skate on yourself or
another creature, the subject of the power retains equilibrium by
mental desire alone, allowing her to gracefully skate along the ground,
turn, or stop suddenly as desired. The skater&rsquo;s land speed
increases by
15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) As with
any effect that increases speed, this power affects the subject&rsquo;s
maximum jumping distance.</p>
<p>The subject can skate up or down any incline or decline she
could
normally walk upon without mishap, though skating up an incline reduces
the subject&rsquo;s speed to normal, while skating down a decline
increases
her speed by an additional 15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as a

<b>Power Points:</b> 5

<p>Your psicrystal takes over the responsibility of maintaining
concentration on any single power you have manifested and are
concentrating on. While maintaining
this
concentration, the psicrystal is limited to move actions in each round,
as normal. When the duration of solicit psicrystal expires, the power
you transferred to the psicrystal ends (even if this would mean that
the power ends earlier than normal). If necessary, the psicrystal makes
<a href="psionicSkills.html#concentration"

Concentration modifier.</p>
<p>You can manifest this power (and transfer the responsibility)
with an
instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power before
you take any other actions in a round. Manifesting the power is a swift
action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the
normal limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this
power when it isn&rsquo;t your turn.</p>

starvation as appropriate.</p>

<p>You receive one kind of sensory input when a different sense

<p>You must succeed on ranged attack rolls (one per creature or

thrown) to hit the target of the hurled items with the items, applying
your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity

1 point per 25 pounds of weight (for less dangerous objects such as an
empty barrel) to 1d6 points per 25 pounds of weight (for hard, dense

<b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 6

<b>Display:</b> None

<b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 swift action

<b>Range:</b> Personal

<b>Target:</b> You

<b>Duration:</b> 1 round (in apparent time); see text

<b>Power Points:</b> 11

<p>You enter another time frame, speeding up so greatly that all
other
creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at normal
speed. You are free to act for 1 round of apparent time. You can
manifest powers, cast spells, move, or perform other types of actions,
subject to the restrictions outlined below.</p>
<p>While your temporal acceleration is in effect, other creatures
are
invulnerable to your attacks and powers. This means you cannot target a
creature with any attack or power. However, a power you manifest that
affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration
of your temporal acceleration has its normal effect on creatures in the
area once this power ends.</p>
<p>You can affect an unattended object but not an object held,
carried, or
worn by another creature. You are undetectable by any means while your
temporal acceleration lasts.</p>
<p>While under the effect of this power, you cannot enter an area
protected by a <a href="psionicPowersGtoP.html#null-psionics-field"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">null psionics field</a> or by a
power or spell that
neutralizes high-level powers or spells. Normal and magical fire, cold,
acid, and the like can still harm you.</p>
<p>When your temporal acceleration expires, you resume acting
during your
current turn in the standard time frame. You are <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#shaken"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">shaken</a> for 1 round
upon your return to the standard time frame.</p>
<p>Splintered or partitioned minds within your own mind, such as
might be
in effect through the use of powers such as <a href="#schism"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">schism</a>, are not temporally
speeded up, even if your second mind manifested this power (your
primary mind gains the benefit, while your second mind remains stuck in
the standard time frame).</p>
<p>Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a
quickened
power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per
round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn&rsquo;t your turn.</p>
<p><b>Augment:</b> For every 4 additional power points you spend,
this power&rsquo;s

<p>The subject of the power hops forward in time 1 round for

a shimmer of silver energy, then reappear after the duration of this
power expires. The subject reappears in exactly the same orientation
and condition as before. From the subject&rsquo;s point of view, no
time has
passed at all.</p>
<p>In each round of the power&rsquo;s duration, on what would
have been
the
subject&rsquo;s turn, it can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom check. Success
allows the
subject to return. The subject can act normally on its next turn after
this power ends.</p>

his
return to the time stream, he appears in the closest unoccupied space,
still in his original orientation. Determine the closest space randomly
if necessary.</p>

&ldquo;replay&rdquo; the previous round of activity. The power
regresses time to

undoing the effects of everyone else&rsquo;s actions in the meantime.
Once
you have used time regression, only you retain knowledge of what

During the round that you live through a second time, you can act on
knowledge you previously gained by already living through the immediate

<p>You induce the formation of a slender vortex of fiercely
swirling air.
When you manifest it, a vortex of air visibly and audibly snakes out
from your outstretched hand.</p>
<p>If you want to aim the vortex at a specific creature, you can
make a
ranged touch attack to strike the creature. If you succeed, direct
contact with the vortex deals 8d6 points of damage to the creature (no
save).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether your ranged touch attack hits (and even
if you
forgo the attack), all creatures in the area (including the one
possibly damaged by direct contact) are picked up and violently dashed
about, dealing 17d6 points of damage to each one. Creatures that make a
successful Reflex save take half damage.</p>
<p>After being dashed about, each creature that was affected
finds itself
situated in a new space 1d4 x 10 feet away from its original space in a
random direction. Walls and other barriers can restrict this
relocation; in such a case, the creature ends up adjacent to the
barrier.</p>
