<p><i>First Aid</i>: You usually use first aid to save a <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dying</a> character. If a character
has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per
round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stable"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">stable</a>. A stable character
regains no hit points but stops losing them.</p>
<p><i>Long-Term Care</i>: Providing long-term care means treating
a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful,
the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to
ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a
full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full
day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest
in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.
You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items
and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in
settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the
healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.</p>
<p><i>Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones</i>:
A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal
speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.</p>
<p>A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell
must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by
one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10
minutes to dress the victim&#8217;s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check
against the spell&#8217;s save DC.</p>
<p><i>Treat Poison</i>: To treat poison means to tend a single
character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage
from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned
character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal
check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her
saving throw, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><i>Treat Disease</i>: To treat a disease means to tend a
single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw
against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character
uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or
treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a
creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10
minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light
activity.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. Generally speaking, you can&#8217;t try a
Heal check again without proof of the original check&#8217;s failure. You can
always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the
previous attempt is still alive.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A character with the <a
href="featsAll.html#self-sufficient" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Self-Sufficient</a>
feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.</p>
<p>A healer&#8217;s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal
checks.</p>
<h5>LISTEN (WIS)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: Your Listen check is either made
against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that you might hear,
or it is opposed by your target&#8217;s <a
href="skillsAll.html#move-silently" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Move
Silently</a> check.</p>

<p>In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the
table could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the
indicated DC would be their average check result. </p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear
something in a reactive manner (such as when someone makes a noise or
you move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without using an
action. Trying to hear something you failed to hear previously is a
move action.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can try to hear something that you
failed to hear previously with no penalty.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: When several characters are listening to the
same thing, a single 1d20 roll can be used for all the individuals&#8217;
Listen checks.</p>
<p>A <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fascinated"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">fascinated</a> creature takes a &#8211;4

<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#alertness"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Alertness</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Listen checks.</p>
<p>A ranger gains a bonus on Listen checks when using this skill
against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>An elf, gnome, or halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Listen
checks. </p>
<p>A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Listen checks.</p>
<p>A sleeping character may make Listen checks at a &#8211;10 penalty.
A successful check awakens the sleeper.</p>
<h5>PROFESSION (WIS; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>
<p class="initial">Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession
is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several
Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a
separate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or
making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation
requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. </p>
<p><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent
living, earning about half your Profession check result in gold pieces
per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your
trade, how to perform the profession&#8217;s daily tasks, how to supervise
helpers, and how to handle common problems.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Not applicable. A single check generally
represents a week of work.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill
to earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly
wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a
week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt
to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.</p>
<p><b>Untrained</b>: Untrained laborers and assistants (that is,
characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver
piece per day.</p>
<h5>SENSE MOTIVE (WIS)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: A successful check lets you
avoid being bluffed (see the <a href="skillsAll.html#bluff"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Bluff</a> skill). You can also use
this skill to determine when &#8220;something is up&#8221; (that is, something odd
is going on) or to assess someone&#8217;s trustworthiness. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="width: 150px">Task</th>
<th>Sense Motive DC</th>
</tr>
<tr class="odd-row">

<tr>

<td align="center">25 or 15</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd-row">
<td>Discern secret message</td>
<td align="center">Varies</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><i>Hunch</i>: This use of the skill involves making a gut
assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from
another&#8217;s behavior that something is wrong, such as when you&#8217;re talking
to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is
trustworthy.</p>
<p><i>Sense Enchantment</i>: You can tell that someone&#8217;s behavior
is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a
mind-affecting effect), even if that person isn&#8217;t aware of it. The
usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see dominate person),
the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target&#8217;s
activities.</p>
<p><i>Discern Secret Message</i>: You may use Sense Motive to
detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill.
In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of
the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information
relating to the message that you are missing, you take a &#8211;2 penalty on
your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that
something hidden is being communicated, but you can&#8217;t learn anything
specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you
intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you
don&#8217;t detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you
infer some false information.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Trying to gain information with Sense Motive
generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening
trying to get a sense of the people around you.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: No, though you may make a Sense Motive check
for each Bluff check made against you.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks
when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#negotiator"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Negotiator</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Sense Motive checks.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive,
you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Diplomacy</a> checks.</p>
<h5>SPOT (WIS)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: The Spot skill is used primarily
to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot
check is opposed by the <a href="skillsAll.html#hide"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Hide</a> check of the creature
trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn&#8217;t intentionally hiding
but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary
to notice it.</p>
<p>A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become
aware of an <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a> creature near you,
though you can&#8217;t actually see it.</p>
<p>Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the
Disguise skill), and to read lips when you can&#8217;t hear or understand
what someone is saying.</p>
<p>Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at
which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending
on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an
additional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is
distracted (not concentrating on being observant).</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><i>Read Lips</i>: To understand what someone is saying by
reading lips, you must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see
him or her speak, and understand the speaker&#8217;s language. (This use of
the skill is language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases
for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line
of sight to the lips being read.</p>
<p>If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general
content of a minute&#8217;s worth of speaking, but you usually still miss
certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can&#8217;t read the
speaker&#8217;s lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, you draw some
incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in
this case, so that you don&#8217;t know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot
something in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using
an action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a
move action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute
before making a Spot check, and you can&#8217;t perform any other action
(other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can try to spot something that you
failed to see previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips
once per minute.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fascinated"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">fascinated</a> creature takes a &#8211;4
penalty on Spot checks made as reactions.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#alertness"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Alertness</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>A ranger gains a bonus on Spot checks when using this skill
against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>The master of a hawk familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks
in daylight or other lighted areas.</p>
<p>The master of an owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks
in shadowy or other darkened areas.</p>
<h5>SURVIVAL (WIS)</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: You can keep yourself and others
safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs for various
tasks that require Survival checks.</p>
<p>Survival does not allow you to follow difficult tracks unless
you are a ranger or have the Track feat (see the Restriction section
below).</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">

<tr class="odd-row">
<td align="center">10</td>

<tr>
<td align="center">15</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd-row">
<td align="center">Varies</td>
<td>Follow tracks (see the Track feat).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><b>Action</b>: Varies. A single Survival check may represent
activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made
to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even
longer.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. For getting along in the wild or for
gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a
Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies
until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural
hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for
one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid
a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can
retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of
searching.</p>
<p><b>Restriction</b>: While anyone can use Survival to find
tracks (regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the
task is 10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat)
can use Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you
can automatically determine where true north lies in relation to
yourself.</p>
<p>A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this
skill to find or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#self-sufficient"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Self-Sufficient</a> feat, you get a
+2 bonus on Survival checks.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you
get a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#knowledge"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Knowledge</a> (nature) checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you
get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a
+2 bonus on Survival checks in aboveground natural environments
(aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, and plains).</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get
a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to
avoid natural hazards.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get
a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="skillsAll.html#search"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a>, you get a +2 bonus on
Survival checks to find or follow tracks.</p>
