## Prestige Classes

Prestige classes offer a new form of multiclassing. Unlike the basic classes, characters must meet Requirements before they can take their first level of a prestige class. The rules for level advancement apply to this system, meaning the first step of advancement is always choosing a class. If a character does not meet the Requirements for a prestige class before that first step, that character cannot take the first level of that prestige class. Taking a prestige class does not incur the experience point penalties normally associated with multiclassing.
There are 15 prestige classes defined in the SRD. They are:

1. Arcane Archer
2. Arcane Trickster
3. Archmage
4. Assassin
5. Blackguard
6. Dragon Disciple
7. Duelist
8. Dwarven Defender
9. Eldritch Knight
10. Hierophant
11. Horizon Walker
12. Loremaster
13. Mystic Theurge
14. Shadowdancer
15. Thaumaturgist
