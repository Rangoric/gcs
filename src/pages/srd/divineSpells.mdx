<p class="initial">Clerics, druids, experienced paladins, and
experienced rangers can cast divine spells. Unlike arcane spells,
divine spells draw power from a divine source. Clerics gain spell power
from deities or from divine forces. The divine force of nature powers
druid and ranger spells. The divine forces of law and good power
paladin spells. Divine spells tend to focus on healing and protection
and are less flashy, destructive, and disruptive than arcane spells.</p>
<a id="preparing-divine-spells"></a><h5>PREPARING DIVINE SPELLS</h5>
<p class="initial">Divine spellcasters prepare their spells in
largely the same manner as wizards do, but with a few differences. The
relevant ability for divine spells is Wisdom. To prepare a divine
spell, a character must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell&#8217;s level.
Likewise, bonus spells are based on Wisdom.</p>
<a id="preparing-divine-spells-time-of-day"></a><p><b>Time of Day</b>: A divine spellcaster chooses and prepares
spells ahead of time, just as a wizard does. However, a divine
spellcaster does not require a period of rest to prepare spells.
Instead, the character chooses a particular part of the day to pray and
receive spells. The time is usually associated with some daily event.
If some event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, he
must do so as soon as possible. If the character does not stop to pray
for spells at the first opportunity, he must wait until the next day to
prepare spells.</p>
<a id="divine-spell-selection-and-preparation"></a><p><b>Spell Selection and Preparation</b>: A divine spellcaster
selects and prepares spells ahead of time through prayer and meditation
at a particular time of day. The time required to prepare spells is the
same as it is for a wizard (1 hour), as is the requirement for a
relatively peaceful environment. A divine spellcaster does not have to
prepare all his spells at once. However, the character&#8217;s mind is
considered fresh only during his or her first daily spell preparation,
so a divine spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or
she has cast a spell or abandoned a previously prepared spell.</p>
<p>Divine spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a
character&#8217;s spell selection is limited to the spells on the list for
his or her class. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers have separate
spell lists. A cleric also has access to two domains determined during
his character creation. Each domain gives him access to a domain spell
at each spell level from 1st to 9th, as well as a special granted
power. With access to two domain spells at each spell level&#8212;one from
each of his two domains&#8212;a cleric must prepare, as an extra domain
spell, one or the other each day for each level of spell he can cast.
If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, it can be prepared
only in a domain spell slot.</p>
<a id="preparing-divine-spells-and-spell-slots"></a><p><b>Spell Slots</b>: The character class tables show how many
spells of each level a character can cast per day.</p>
<p>These openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A
spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot
with a lower level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability
score to cast spells that would otherwise be his or her due still gets
the slots but must fill them with spells of lower level. </p>
<a id="preparing-divine-spells-and-recent-casting-limit"></a><p><b>Recent Casting Limit</b>: As with arcane spells, at the
time of preparation any spells cast within the previous 8 hours count
against the number of spells that can be prepared.</p>
<a id="spontaneous-casting-of-cure-and-inflict-spells"></a><p><b>Spontaneous Casting of Cure and Inflict Spells</b>: A good
cleric (or a cleric of a good deity) can spontaneously cast a cure
spell in place of a prepared spell of the same level or higher, but not
in place of a domain spell. An evil cleric (or a cleric of an evil
deity) can spontaneously cast an inflict spell in place of a prepared
spell (one that is not a domain spell) of the same level or higher.
Each neutral cleric of a neutral deity either spontaneously casts cure
spells like a good cleric or inflict spells like an evil one, depending
on which option the player chooses when creating the character. The
divine energy of the spell that the cure or inflict spell substitutes
for is converted into the cure or inflict spell as if that spell had
been prepared all along.</p>
<a id="spontaneous-casting-of-summon-natures-allu-spells"></a><p><b>Spontaneous Casting of Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally Spells</b>: A
druid can spontaneously cast a summon nature&#8217;s ally spell in place of a
prepared spell of the same level or higher. The divine energy of the
spell that the summon nature&#8217;s ally spell substitutes for is converted
into the summon spell as if that spell had been prepared all along.</p>
<a id="divine-magical-writings"></a><h5>DIVINE MAGICAL WRITINGS</h5>
<p class="initial">Divine spells can be written down and
deciphered just as arcane spells can (see Arcane Magical Writings,
above). Any character with the <a href="SkillsAll.html#Spellcraft"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spellcraft</a> skill can attempt to
decipher
the divine magical writing and identify it. However, only characters
who have the spell in question (in its divine form) on their class
spell list can cast a divine spell from a scroll.</p>
<a id="gaining-new-divine-spells"></a><h5>NEW DIVINE SPELLS</h5>
<p class="initial">Divine spellcasters most frequently gain new
spells in one of the following two ways.</p>
<a id="spells-gained-at-a-new-level"></a><p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level</b>: Characters who can cast
divine spells undertake a certain amount of study between adventures.
Each time such a character receives a new level of divine spells, he or
she learns new spells from that level automatically.</p>
<a id="independent-research"></a><p><b>Independent Research</b>: A divine spellcaster also can
research a spell independently, much as an arcane spellcaster can. Only
the creator of such a spell can prepare and cast it, unless he decides
to share it with others.</p>
