In this system, every character gains a reputation of one sort or another
as his career progresses, expressed as a reputation bonus. While a
character might try to take advantage of his reputation from time to time,
usually the character�s reputation precedes him &mdash; whether he wants it to or
not.
<p>
Reputation enhances noncombat interaction between characters by providing
bonuses to certain skill checks. Those who recognize a character are more
likely to help him or to do what he asks, provided the character�s
reputation is a positive influence on the NPC or monster that recognizes
him. A high reputation bonus makes it difficult for a character to mask
his identity, which can be a problem if he�s trying not to be noticed.
</p>
<h5><a id="fame-or-infamy"></a>
FAME OR INFAMY
</h5>
What a character�s reputation represents lies in the character�s
interaction with the NPCs or monsters. Most characters with a high
reputation bonus (+4 or higher) are considered well known within their
profession or social circle. Whether this notoriety has a positive or
negative effect depends on the point of view of the person who recognizes
the character.
<h6><a id="nom-de-plumes-and-secret.identities"></a>
Nom De Plumes And Secret Identities
</h6>
If a character successfully uses the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#disguise">Disguise</a> skill or illusion magic to
mask his identity, then what he accomplishes while disguised doesn�t
affect his reputation score for good or ill.
<p>
A character may adopt a nom de plume (as Robin Hood did) or wear a mask or
other costume (as Zorro did) during his adventures. If so, the character
tracks reputation separately for his true identity and his alter ego (much
as comic-book heroes do). If the Crimson Cavalier needs to sneak out of
town after embarrassing the captain of the guard, what better way to do so
than by simply removing his mask, hiding his weapons in an oxcart, and
departing while in his secret identity of Tallin the Dung-Merchant?
</p>
<h5><a id="reputation-checks"></a>
Reputation Checks
</h5>
Most of the time, a character doesn�t decide to use his reputation. The GM
decides when a character�s reputation is relevant to a scene or encounter.
At the moment it becomes pertinent, the GM makes a reputation check for an
NPC or monster that might be influenced in some fashion due to the
character�s notoriety.
<p>
A reputation check is equal to</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px"><b>1d20 + the character�s reputation bonus +
the NPC or monster�s Int modifier.</b></div>
 <p>The GM may substitute a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skill
bonus for the Int modifier if he decides the character�s past activities
apply to a particular field. For example, if the character were a cleric,
Knowledge (religion) might be appropriate. Additional modifiers that might
apply include the following.
</p>

<p>
The standard DC of a reputation check is 25. If the NPC or monster
succeeds on the reputation check, he or she recognizes the character. That
recognition grants a bonus, or penalty, on certain subsequent skill
checks, depending on how the NPC or monster reacts to the character.
</p>
<h5><a id="skill-checks"></a>
SKILL CHECKS
</h5>
When an NPC or monster with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher has a
positive opinion of a character�s reputation, the character gains a bonus
on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#gather-information">Gather Information</a>, and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> checks equal to his
reputation bonus.
<p>
When an NPC or monster with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher has a
negative opinion of a character�s reputation, the character gains a
penalty on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks equal to his reputation bonus.
</p>
<p>
The bonus or penalty on these skill checks applies only when a character
is interacting with an NPC or monster that recognizes the character.
Others present in the encounter are unaffected by the character�s
reputation.
</p>
<h5><a id="npc-reputations"></a>
NPC REPUTATIONS
</h5>
Players decide how their characters act. Sometimes, however, it�s
appropriate for a GM to call for a skill check using an interaction skill
affected by reputation. For example, an NPC might use <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a> to lie to
player characters who, in turn, use <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> to detect the lie. If an
NPC tries to intimidate a player character, the GM can use the NPC�s
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#intimidate">Intimidate</a> check to determine which characters see the NPC as intimidating
and which don�t. Similarly, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check can tell the GM which
characters find an NPC persuasive and which do not. At other times,
players may want to know if their characters recognize a particular NPC or
monster. A reputation check can help GMs in these situations.
<p>
The reputation check to see if a player character recognizes an NPC or
monster is the same as described above. However, the GM should make the
skill check privately and keep the actual result secret. Doing this
prevents players from using reputation checks as a form of radar for
measuring the importance of every NPC they encounter.
</p>
<p>
Modify the results of NPCs� and monsters� interaction skill checks by
their reputation bonuses when they interact with characters who recognize
them.

<p>
A player character has a reputation score based on his class levels;
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-reputation-scores">Table: Reputation Scores</a>, summarizes this information for the standard
player character and NPC classes.
</p>
<p>
A multiclass character has a reputation score according to his class level
in each of his classes, regardless of what his character level is. For
example, an 8th-level <a style="color: #579eb6" href="barbarian.html">barbarian</a>/6th-level <a style="color: #579eb6" href="cleric.html">cleric</a> has a reputation score of
+3 (+2 from his barbarian levels, +1 from his cleric levels). His score
increases to +4 when he reaches 15th level if he takes 7th level in
cleric, but not if he takes 9th level in barbarian.
</p>
<p>
For a class not mentioned on this table, determine the associated
reputation score by assigning the class to a column with classes of a
similar sort. (For instance, the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="assassin.html">assassin</a> class probably has the same
reputation score as the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="rogue.html">rogue</a>, and the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="blackguard.html">blackguard</a> would be equivalent to
the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="paladin.html">paladin</a>.)
</p>
<h5><a id="reputation-based-feats"></a>
REPUTATION-BASED FEATS
</h5>
The following feats can modify reputation bonuses.
<h6><a id="low-profile"></a>
Low Profile (General)
</h6>
You are less famous than others of your class and level, or you wish to
maintain a less visible presence than others of your station.
<p><b>Benefit:</b> Reduce your reputation bonus by 3 points.</p>
<p><b>Special:</b>You can�t select both the Low Profile feat and the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#renown">Renown</a> feat. You�re
either famous or you�re not.</p>
<h6><a id="renown"></a>
Renown (General)
</h6>
You have a better chance of being recognized.
<p><b>Benefit:</b> Increase your reputation bonus by 3 points.</p>
<p><b>Special:</b>You can�t select both the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#low-profile">Low Profile</a> feat and the Renown feat. You�re
either famous or you�re not.</p>
<h5><a id="event-based-reputation"></a>
EVENT-BASED REPUTATION
</h5>
<a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/UnA_Gallery/79182.jpg"><img
class="art-wide" src="pict.jpg" title="" alt="pict"
style="border: 0px solid ; width: 73px; height: 75px;" /></a>Rather than determining reputation increases purely by class levels, the
GM can enhance characters� reputations based on the characters� actual
adventures. At an adventure�s conclusion, he can hand out awards to the
characters who were known to have participated, representing how much more
famous (or infamous) their recent actions have made them.
<p>
This variant doesn�t change much about the game (beyond what the
reputation variant does in general). Characters have a slight incentive to
choose adventures that earn them more fame, because their later social
interactions will be more likely to succeed. But reputation is a
double-edged sword in the d20 game, because it can turn into notoriety
with a simple twist of the plot. The same peasants who buy the PCs drinks
at the tavern one night might try to turn them in for a reward a week
later after the sheriff frames the PCs for murder.
</p>
<p>
If the characters earned public acclaim for ending a threat to the
community�s safety, award each PC a 1-point increase in his or her
reputation score at the adventure�s conclusion. If the accolades came from
a narrower circle of people, such as the merchants of Mosston or the
druids of Tallforest, then each character gets a �-point increase. (A single
�-point increase has no effect on reputation-related skill checks, but two
such increases combine to provide a full 1-point increase.) If what the
characters accomplished in the adventure directly affected, or came to the
attention of, only a few (or no) other people, the PCs don�t get a
reputation boost.
</p>
<p>
This determination is obviously a judgment call. For guidance, the GM can
consult <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-event-based-reputation">Table: Event-Based
Reputation</a>, organized according to how much effect the successful
completion of the adventure would have on the PCs� reputation scores. If
the adventure situation in your game is similar to a particular idea in
the table, then the possible reputation award should be similar as well.
(To generate an adventure idea randomly, roll d% and consult <a style="color: #579eb6" href=
"#table-event-based-reputation">Table: Event-Based Reputation</a>.)
</p>
<p>
From <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-event-based-reputation">Table: Event-Based
Reputation</a>, it�s clear that site-based adventures in which the PCs
function as explorers don�t usually earn reputation awards. Few people
care that four brave people cleared a grown-over ziggurat full of
monsters, because they probably didn�t know about the ziggurat out in the
wilderness to begin with, much less that it was full of monsters.
</p>
<p>
Adventures that affect only a few people likewise don�t earn reputation
awards, unless the people in question are themselves celebrities. But
adventures that affect an entire town or small region are worth � point,
and adventures that affect a large city or nation are worth a full 1
point.
</p>
<p>
The nature of the danger that is overcome is important, too. Merely
annoying or mysterious dangers, such as green smoke coming from a cave
(entry 77 on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-event-based-reputation">Table: Event-Based
Reputation</a>) or a series of sabotaged wagons (entry 87), don�t enhance
PC reputations as much as dangers that create widespread panic and mayhem.
</p>
<p>
Also, regardless of the severity of the danger, if those who benefited
from the PCs� success weren�t aware of the peril from which the PCs saved
them, then the characters� reputation award is � point apiece at best.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: WHO'S AFFECTED BY REPUTATION?
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px"><p>
Hard and fast rules for how far a character�s reputation spreads are more
trouble than they�re worth; whether reputation applies in any situation is
best left up to the GM. But in general, the �radius� of a character�s
reputation slowly increases as she attains higher levels.
</p>
<p>
For example, a low-level character�s reputation score might apply only in
her small town and the immediate surrounding countryside. Perhaps, by the
time she reaches around 10th level, everyone in the province might have
heard of her exploits. When she gets to 15th level or thereabouts, anyone
in the country or region might know of her.
</p>
<p>
But what happens if she then visits the planar city of Xenast? She�s never
been to the place before, and most Xenast residents have never been to the
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="planes.html#material">Material Plane</a>, so her reputation doesn�t follow her there. But once she
accomplishes something (often an adventure) that earns her a measure of
fame in Xenast, her reputation �radius� expands to encompass that city. Not
only do Xenast residents tell tales of her most recent adventure, some
might be curious enough to find out what she accomplished on the Material
Plane before coming to the planar city.
</p>
<p>
With the event-based reputation variant, a character who is a newcomer to
her location has a reputation score of 0 until she earns at least a
�-point increase by succeeding on an adventure in that location. Once she
has done so, she gains the benefit of her full reputation score. (Don�t
track a character�s reputation separately for different areas &mdash; people have
either heard of her, or they haven�t.)
</p>
<p>
When using level-based reputation increases, a character is entitled to
benefit from her full reputation score once she has been in her new
location for at least one level�s worth of adventuring, even if the
adventures themselves didn�t bring her any reputation increases.
</p></div>
