<a id="improving-monsters"></a><h2>Improving Monsters</h2>
<p class="initial">Each of the monster entries describes a
typical creature of its kind. However, there are several methods by
which extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical
creature as the foundation: by adding character classes, increasing a
monster&#8217;s Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods
are not mutually exclusive&#8212;it&#8217;s possible for a monster with a template
to be improved by both increasing its Hit Dice and adding character
class levels.</p>
<a id="class-levels"></a><p><b>Class Levels</b>: Intelligent creatures that are reasonably
humanoid in shape most commonly advance by adding class levels.
Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of &#8220;By character
class&#8221; in their Advancement line. When a monster adds a class level,
that level usually represents an increase in experience and learned
skills and capabilities.</p>
<a id="increased-hit-dice"></a><p><b>Increased Hit Dice</b>: Intelligent creatures that are not
humanoid in shape, and nonintelligent monsters, can advance by
increasing their Hit Dice. Creatures with increased Hit Dice are
usually superior specimens of their race, bigger and more powerful than
their run-of-the-mill fellows.</p>
<a id="added-templates"></a><p><b>Templates</b>: Both intelligent and nonintelligent
creatures with an unusual heritage or an inflicted change in their
essential nature may be modified with a template. Templates usually
result in tougher monsters with capabilities that differ from those of
their common kin.</p>
<p>Each of these three methods for improving monsters is
discussed in more detail below.</p>
<a id="ability-score-arrays"></a><h3>ABILITY SCORE ARRAYS</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="initial">Monsters are assumed to have completely
average (or standard) ability scores&#8212;a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as
modified by their racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are
individuals and often have better than normal ability scores, and
usually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of
ability scores. Monsters who improve by adding a template, and monsters
who improve by increasing their Hit Dice, may use any of the three
arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be
improved could easily be considered elite.</p>
<a id="elite-array"></a><p><b>Elite Array</b>: The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
While the monster has one weakness compared to a typical member of its
race, it is significantly better overall. The elite array is most
appropriate for monsters who add levels in a player character class.</p>
<a id="nonelite-array"></a><p><b>Nonelite Array</b>: The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10,
9, 8. The nonelite array does not necessarily make a monster better
than normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with
strengths and weaknesses compared to a typical member of its race. The
nonelite array is most appropriate for monsters who add class levels in
a NPC class.</p>
<a id="ability-score-improvement"></a><p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b>: Treat monster Hit Dice the
same as character level for determining ability score increases. This
only applies to Hit Dice increases, monsters do not gain ability score
increases for levels they &#8220;already reached&#8221; with their racial Hit Dice,
since these adjustments are included in their basic ability scores.</p>
<a id="monsters-and-class-levels"></a><h3>MONSTERS AND CLASS LEVELS</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="initial">If a creature acquires a character class, it
follows the rules for multiclass characters.</p>
<p>The creature&#8217;s Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it
has plus its racial Hit Dice. A creature&#8217;s &#8220;monster class&#8221; is always a
favored class, and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it.
Additional Hit Dice gained from taking levels in a character class
never affect a creature&#8217;s size.</p>
<a id="humanoids-and-class-levels"></a><p><b>Humanoids and Class Levels</b>: Creatures with 1 or less HD
replace their monster levels with their character levels. The monster
loses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted
by its 1 monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills,
feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level character of the
appropriate class.</p>
<a id="level-adjustment-and-effective-character-level"></a><p><b>Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level</b>: To
determine the effective character level (ECL) of a monster character,
add its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class
levels. The monster is considered to have experience points equal to
the minimum needed to be a character of its ECL. </p>
<p>If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its
character level for purposes of determining how much equipment it can
purchase. Generally, only monsters with an Advancement entry of &#8220;By
character class&#8221; receive NPC gear; other creatures adding character
levels should be treated as monsters of the appropriate CR and assigned
treasure, not equipment.</p>
<a id="feat-aquisition-and-ability-score-increases"></a><p><b>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases</b>: A
monster&#8217;s total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its acquisition of feats
and ability score increases. </p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p class="initial">Certain creatures are created by adding a
template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a
freak of nature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or
the first generation of offspring from parents of different species.</p>
<a id="acquired-and-inherited-templates"></a><h5>ACQUIRED AND INHERITED TEMPLATES</h5>
<p class="initial">Some templates can be added to creatures
anytime. Templates such as these are referred to as acquired templates,
indicating that the creature did not always have the attributes of the
template.</p>
<p>Other templates, known as inherited templates, are part of a
creature from the beginning of its existence. Creatures are born with
these templates.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible for a certain kind of template to be of either
type. </p>
<a id="reading-a-template"></a><h5>READING A TEMPLATE</h5>
<p class="initial">A template&#8217;s description provides a set of
instructions for altering an existing creature, known as the base
creature. The changes that a template might cause to each line of a
creature &#8217;s statistics block are discussed below. Generally, if a
template does not cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is
missing from the template description. For clarity, the entry for a
statistic or attribute that is not changed is sometimes given as &#8220;Same
as the base creature.&#8221; </p>
<a id="template-size-and-type"></a><p><b>Size and Type</b>: Templates often change a creature&#8217;s
type, and may change the creature&#8217;s size.</p>
<p>If a template changes the base creature&#8217;s type, the creature
also acquires the augmented subtype unless the template description
indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired with the
creature&#8217;s original type. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the
new creature has the traits of the new type but the features of the
original type.</p>
<p>If a template changes a creature&#8217;s size, use Table: Changes to
Statistics by Size to calculate changes to natural armor, Armor Class,
attack rolls, and grapple bonus.</p>
<a id="template-hit-dice-and-hit-points"></a><p><b>Hit Dice and Hit Points</b>: Most templates do not change
the number of Hit Dice a monster has, but some do. Some templates
change the size of a creature&#8217;s Hit Dice (usually by changing the
creature type). A few templates change previously acquired Hit Dice,
and continue to change Hit Dice gained with class levels, but most
templates that change Hit Dice change only the creature&#8217;s original HD
and leave class Hit Dice unchanged.</p>
<p>If the Hit Dice entry in a template description is missing,
Hit Dice and hit points do not change unless the creature&#8217;s
Constitution modifier changes.</p>
<a id="template-initiative"></a><p><b>Initiative</b>: If a template changes the monster&#8217;s
Dexterity, or if it adds or removes the Improved Initiative feat, this
entry changes.</p>
<a id="template-speed"></a><p><b>Speed</b>: If a template modifies a creature&#8217;s speed, the
template states how that happens. More commonly, a template adds a new
movement mode.</p>
<a id="template-armor-class"></a><p><b>Armor Class</b>: If a template changes the creature&#8217;s size,
see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to determine its new Armor
Class and to see whether its natural armor changes. In some cases the
method of determining Armor Class changes radically; the template
description explains how to adjust the creature&#8217;s AC.</p>
<a id="template-base-attack-and-grapple"></a><p><b>Base Attack/Grapple</b>: Templates usually do not change a
creature&#8217;s base attack bonus. If a template modifies a creature&#8217;s base
attack bonus, the template description states how that happens. Changes
to a creature&#8217;s Strength score can change a creature&#8217;s grapple bonus,
as can changes to its size.</p>
<a id="template-attack-and-full-attack"></a><p><b>Attack and Full Attack</b>: Most templates do not change a
creature&#8217;s attack bonus or modes of attack, even when the creature&#8217;s
type changes (the creature&#8217;s base attack bonus is the same as a
creature of the original type). Of course, any change in ability scores
may affect attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use the
new modifier to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster&#8217;s size
also changes its attack bonus; see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.</p>
<a id="template-damage"></a><p><b>Damage</b>: Damage changes with Strength. If the creature
uses a two-handed weapon or has a single natural weapon, it adds 1-1/2
times its Strength bonus to the damage. If it has more than a single
attack then it adds its Strength bonus to damage rolls for the primary
attack and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all secondary attacks.</p>
<a id="template-space-reach"></a><p><b>Space/Reach</b>: A template may change this entry if it
changes the monster&#8217;s size. Note that this table does not take into
account special situations such as exceptional reach.</p>
<a id="template-special-attacks"></a><p><b>Special Attacks</b>: A template may add or remove special
attacks. The template description gives the details of any special
attacks a template provides, including how to determine saving throw
DCs, if applicable.</p>
<a id="template-special-qualities"></a><p><b>Special Qualities</b>: A template may add or remove special
qualities. The template description gives the details of any special
qualities a template provides, including how to determine saving throw
DCs, if applicable. Even if the special qualities entry is missing from
a template description, the creature still gains any qualities
associated with its new type.</p>
<a id="template-base-saves"></a><p><b>Base Saves</b>: As with attacks, changing a monster&#8217;s type
does not always change its base saving throw bonuses. You only need to
adjust them for new modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom. A
template may, however, state that a monster has a different &#8220;good&#8221;
saving throw.</p>
<a id="template-abilities"></a><p><b>Abilities</b>: If a template changes one or more ability
scores, these changes are noted here.</p>
<a id="template-skills"></a><p><b>Skills</b>: As with attacks, changing a monster&#8217;s type does
not always change its skill points. Most templates don&#8217;t change the
number of Hit Dice a creature has, so you don&#8217;t need to adjust skills
in that case unless the key abilities for those skills have changed, or
the template gives a bonus on one or more skills, or unless the
template gives a feat that provides a bonus on a skill check. </p>
<p>Some templates change how skill points are determined, but
this change usually only affects skill points gained after the template
is applied. Treat skills listed in the base creature&#8217;s description as
class skills, as well as any new skills provided by the template. </p>
<a id="template-feats"></a><p><b>Feats</b>: Since most templates do not change the number of
Hit Dice a creature has, a template will not change the number of feats
the creature has. Some templates grant one or more bonus feats.</p>
<a id="template-environment"></a><p><b>Environment</b>: Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
<a id="template-organization"></a><p><b>Organization</b>: Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
<a id="template-challenge-rating"></a><p><b>Challenge Rating</b>: Most templates increase the
creature&#8217;s Challenge Rating. A template might provide a modifier to be
added to the base creature&#8217;s CR, or it might specify a range of
modifiers depending on the base creature&#8217;s original Hit Dice or CR.</p>
<a id="template-treasure"></a><p><b>Treasure</b>: Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
<a id="template-alignment"></a><p><b>Alignment</b>: Usually the same as the base creature,
unless the template is associated with a certain alignment.</p>
<a id="template-advancement"></a><p><b>Advancement</b>: Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
<a id="template-level-adjustment"></a><p><b>Level Adjustment</b>: This entry is a modifier to the base
creature&#8217;s level adjustment. Any level adjustment is meaningless unless
the creature retains a high enough Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain
class levels after applying the template.</p>
<a id="adding-more-than-one-template"></a><h6>Adding More Than One Template</h6>
<p class="initial">In theory, there&#8217;s no limit to the number of
templates you can add to a creature. To add more than one template,
just apply each template one at a time. Always apply inherited
templates before applying acquired templates. Whenever you add multiple
templates, pay attention to the creature&#8217;s type&#8212;you may add a template
that makes the creature ineligible for other templates you might want
to add.</p>

<p class="initial">When adding class levels to a creature with 1
or less HD, you advance the creature like a character. Otherwise, use
the following guidelines.</p>
<a id="adding-class-levels"></a><h5>ADDING CLASS LEVELS</h5>
<p class="initial">If you are advancing a monster by adding
player character class levels, decide if the class levels directly
improve the monster&#8217;s existing capabilities.</p>
<p>When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it
typical ability scores appropriate for that class. Most creatures are
built using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10,
10, adjusted by racial modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use
the elite array of ability scores before racial adjustments: 15, 14,
13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with NPC classes use the nonelite array of 13,
12, 11, 10, 9, 8. T</p>
<a id="associated-class-levels"></a><h6>Associated Class Levels</h6>
<p class="initial">Class levels that increase a monster&#8217;s
existing strengths are known as associated class levels. Each
associated class level a monster has increases its CR by 1.</p>
<p>Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes
for a creature that relies on its fighting ability.</p>
<p>Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that
relies on stealth to surprise its foes, or on skill use to give itself
an advantage. </p>
<p>A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature
that already has the ability to cast spells as a character of the class
in question, since the monster&#8217;s levels in the spellcasting class stack
with its innate spellcasting ability.</p>
<a id="nonassociated-class-levels"></a><h6>Nonassociated Class Levels</h6>
<p class="initial">If you add a class level that doesn&#8217;t directly
play to a creature&#8217;s strength the class level is considered
nonassociated, and things get a little more complicated. Adding a
nonassociated class level to a monster increases its CR by 1/2 per
level until one of its nonassociated class levels equals its original
Hit Dice. At that point, each additional level of the same class or a
similar one is considered associated and increases the monster&#8217;s CR by
1.</p>
<p>Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.</p>
<a id="adding-hit-dice"></a><h5>ADDING HIT DICE</h5>
<p class="initial">When you improve a monster by adding Hit Dice,
use Table: Improved Monster CR Increase to determine the effect on the
creature&#8217;s CR. Keep in mind that many monsters that advance by adding
Hit Dice also increase in size. Do not stack this CR increase with any
increase from class levels. In general, once you&#8217;ve doubled a
creature&#8217;s CR, you should closely watch any additional increases in its
abilities. Adding Hit Dice to a creature improves several of its
abilities, and radical increases might not follow this progression
indefinitely. Compare the monster&#8217;s improved attack bonus, saving throw
bonuses, and any DCs of its special abilities from the HD increase to
typical characters of the appropriate level and adjust the CR
accordingly.</p>

<a id="increasing-size"></a><h5>INCREASING SIZE</h5>
<p class="initial">Generally, increasing a monster&#8217;s size
increases its combat effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased
Strength, reach, and other benefits. Apply this modifier if you
increase a creature beyond Medium and in conjunction with any other
increases.</p>
<p>Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size
may actually lose effectiveness because of a size increase. Monsters
that don&#8217;t benefit from size increases don&#8217;t advance in that manner for
this reason.</p>
<a id="adding-special-abilities"></a><h5>ADDING SPECIAL ABILITIES</h5>
<p class="initial">You can add any sort of spell-like,
supernatural, or extraordinary ability to a creature. As with a class
level, you should determine how much, or how little, this ability adds
to the creature&#8217;s existing repertoire. A suite of abilities that work
together should be treated as a single modifier for this purpose. If
the ability (or combination of abilities) significantly increases the
monster&#8217;s combat effectiveness, increase its CR by 2. Minor abilities
increase the creature&#8217;s CR by 1, and truly trivial abilities may not
increase CR at all. If the special abilities a monster gains are not
tied to a class or Hit Die increase, this CR increase stacks.</p>
<p>A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance
of incapacitating or crippling a character in one round. A significant
special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster&#8217;s
