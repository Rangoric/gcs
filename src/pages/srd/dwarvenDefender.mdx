<a id="dwarven-defender-class-features"></a><h6>Class Features</h6>


<p class="initial">All of the following are Class Features of the
dwarven defender prestige class.</p>
<a id="dwarven-defender-ac-bonus"></a><p><b>AC Bonus (Ex)</b>: The dwarven defender receives a dodge
bonus to Armor Class that starts at +1 and improves as the defender
gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A dwarven defender is
proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and
shields.</p>
<a id="dwarven-defender-defensive-stance"></a><p><b>Defensive Stance</b>: When he adopts a defensive stance, a
defender gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move
from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to
Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus
to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender&#8217;s hit points
by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the
defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These
extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.
While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities
that would require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts
for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character&#8217;s (newly improved)
Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance
voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance,
the defender is winded and takes a &#8211;2 penalty to Strength for the
duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive
stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level
(see Table: The Dwarven Defender). Using the defensive stance takes no
time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action.</p>
<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</b>: Starting at 2nd level, a dwarven
defender retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being
caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses
any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)</p>
<p>If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the
character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).</p>
<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a dwarven defender gains
a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to
AC against attacks by traps. At 8th level, these bonuses rise to +2.
These bonuses stack with trap sense bonuses gained from other classes.</p>
<a id="dwarven-defender-damage-reduction"></a><p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex)</b>: At 6th level, a dwarven defender
gains damage reduction. Subtract 3 points from the damage the dwarven
defender takes each time he is dealt damage. At 10th level, this damage
reduction rises to 6/&#8211;. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not
below 0.</p>
<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</b>: At 6th level, a dwarven
defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the
ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the dwarven defender.</p>
<p>The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four
levels higher than the dwarven defender can flank him (and thus sneak
attack him).</p>
<p>If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second
class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the
levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level
required to flank the character.</p>
<a id="dwarven-defender-mobile-defense"></a><p><b>Mobile Defense (Ex)</b>: At 8th level, a dwarven defender
can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in
a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without
losing the benefit of the stance.</p>
