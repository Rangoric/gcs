In this variant, a character who has been the target of a spell sometimes
finds that some of its magic rubs off on him or her permanently, leaving
an echo of the original spell. A character who has alter self cast on her
many times, for example, may develop the spell-like ability to alter her
features into the specific form she's most familiar with. Beneficial
spells can linger on a character like magic radiation, bestowing an
advantage somehow related to the original spell. In contrast, some PCs
have a homeopathic reaction to hostile spells; by suffering the effects of
a spell, they develop a countermeasure to it.
<p>
Such spelltouched characters are a mystery to academic-minded
spellcasters, who can't reliably duplicate the process by repeatedly
casting the same spell on a subject. Magic interacts with each individual
in a subtly different way.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, the only way to become eligible to select a spelltouched feat
is to have been exposed to (that is, targeted by or otherwise affected by)
one of the spells associated with the feat. if the spell allows a save,
you must have failed a saving throw against
it at least once, whether intentionally or not. After meeting the
prerequisite, you may select a spelltouched feat when your character would
otherwise qualify for a feat. The exposure is the game-world explanation
for your new power, and the feat choice is the trade-off that keeps the
game balanced.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: SPELLTOUCHED FEATS
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">Standard feats rarely give your character overtly magical powers. Instead,
they represent outstanding natural ability or rigorous training. Some
feats such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#spell-focus">Spell Focus</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#spell-penetration">Spell Penetration</a>, and metamagic feats make
your existing magic better in some respect, but they don't give you
magical power you didn't already have.
<p>
Spelltouched feats break that rule wide open, giving characters abilities
previously impossible without the aid of magic. But they're balanced
against standard feats, so characters who choose them aren't necessarily
more powerful than their nonspelltouched counterparts.
</p>
<p>
If you use this variant, you'll find that magic becomes incrementally more
important in your game, and even characters who rely on their martial
prowess, such as fighters, sometimes manifest a magical effect.
</p>
<p>
Because these feats are variants, they employ other game mechanics rarely
seen in feats, such as a drawback that accompanies the feat or a limited
number of uses per day or week.

SPELLTOUCHED FEAT DESCRIPTIONS
</h5>
The spelltouched feats described below follow the normal format for feats.
<h6><a id="accurate-jaunt"></a>
Accurate Jaunt [Spelltouched]
</h6>
You have an instinctive sense of interplanar travel.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#greater-teleport">greater teleport</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#plane-shift">plane shift</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#teleport">teleport</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#shadow-walk">shadow walk</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
When you use <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#teleport">teleport</a>, you can roll the targeting roll twice, taking
whichever result you prefer. When you use <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#plane-shift">plane shift</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#shadow-walk">shadow walk</a>, you
likewise make the roll to determine your destination twice, choosing the
better (usually lower) result.
</p>
<h6><a id="bladeproof-skin"></a>
Bladeproof Skin [Spelltouched]
</h6>
Your skin has a degree of protection from even the sharpest edge.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#stoneskin">stoneskin</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#iron-body">iron body</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
You gain <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#DR">damage reduction</a> 3/bludgeoning. Your skin imposes an armor check
penalty of 2 (which stacks with the armor check penalty from armor and
shield).
</p>
<h6><a id="breadth-of-knowledge"></a>
Breadth of Knowledge [Spelltouched]
</h6>
Your time spent plumbing the depths of magic knowledge has resulted in a
treasure trove of obscure facts.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#legend-lore">legend lore</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#vision">vision</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
All <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> checks you make are treated as trained checks, even if you
don't have any ranks in the specific skill. If you have at least one rank
in the specific Knowledge skill in question, you gain a +1 bonus on the
check.
</p>
<h6><a id="conductivity"></a>
Conductivity [Spelltouched]
</h6>
You have crude control over electricity effects near you.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#call-lightning">call lightning</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#lightning-bolt">lightning bolt</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#chain-lightning">chain lightning</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
Whenever you take damage from an electricity effect, you may send a line
of electricity arcing from your body at any single target within 30 feet.
This bolt deals half the damage you just took; a Reflex save (DC 16 + your
Cha modifier) halves this damage.
</p>
<h6><a id="controlled-immolation"></a>
Controlled Immolation [Spelltouched]
</h6>
If you catch on fire, the flames don't hurt you.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsFtoG.html#fireball">fireball</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#delayed-blast-fireball">delayed blast fireball</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
If you <a style="color: #579eb6" href="wildernessAndEnvironment.html#catching-on-fire">catch on fire</a>,
you take no damage from the flames. A creature striking you with its body
or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage. The fire persists on
your body for 1d4 rounds.
</p>
<p>
This feat doesn't protect you from other sources of fire damage, whether
magical or not, only from the effects of catching on fire. It also doesn't
protect your equipment from the effects of fire.
</p>
<h6><a id="eyes-to-the-sky"></a>
Eyes to the Sky [Spelltouched]
</h6>
You have an instinctive sense of when someone is magically watching you.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#scrying">scrying</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#greater-scrying">greater scrying</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
You automatically spot the magical sensor created by a spell of the
scrying subtype (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#arcane-eye">arcane eye</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#clairaudience-claircoyance">clairaudience/clairvoyance</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#greater-scrying">greater scrying</a>,
or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#scrying">scrying</a>) if it's within 40 feet of you.
</p>
<h6><a id="false-pretenses"></a>
False Pretenses [Spelltouched]
</h6>
Those who try to charm you get an unpleasant surprise.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#charm-person">charm</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#dominate-person">dominate</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
When you succeed on a save against a charm or compulsion effect, the
character trying to charm or compel you believes that you failed your
save. You can play along voluntarily if you wish to. if the charm or
compulsion involves telepathic commands, you continue to receive them,
although you aren't obligated to follow them.
</p>
<h6><a id="ineluctable-echo"></a>
Ineluctable Echo [Spelltouched]
</h6>
Those who use words of power around you hear the sound of their own
voices.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#wail-of-the-banshee">wail of the banshee</a> or any <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#power-word-blind">power word</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
When you are targeted by a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#power-word-blind">power word</a> spell, whoever speaks the power word
is also affected by it (as if he had cast it on himself). Likewise, when
you're within the area of a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#wail-of-the-banshee">wail of the banshee</a> spell, the caster of the
spell also hears the wail and must succeed on a Fortitude save (using his
own save DC) or die.
</p>
<p>
Possessing the Ineluctable Echo feat doesn't protect you against power
word or wail of the banshee spells. You experience their effects normally.
</p>
<h6><a id="life-leech"></a>
Life Leech [Spelltouched]
</h6>
You automatically try to steal the last bit of life energy from anyone
nearby.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="clericDomains.html#death">death touch</a> domain granted power or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#death-knell">death knell</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
Each dying or stable creature within 30 feet of you (that is, any creature
with -1 to -9 hit points) loses an additional 1 hit point at the beginning
of your turn. You gain the same amount as temporary hit points that last
for 10 minutes. You can't suppress this effect, which functions on both
friend and foe.
</p>
<h6><a id="live-my-nightmare"></a>
Live My Nightmare [Spelltouched]
</h6>
Those who magically pry into your mind become privy to your most
frightening dreams.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#phantasmal-killer">phantasmal killer</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
Whenever someone successfully targets you with a divination spell or
effect, you can send that caster a nightmarish vision. This vision
functions as a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#phantasmal-killer">phantasmal killer</a> spell, except that the form comes from
your dreams, not the other creature's dreams. The other creature must
succeed on a Will save (DC 14 + your Cha modifier) to disbelieve the nightmare and a Fortitude save
(DC 14 + your Cha modifier) to avoid dying from fear.
</p>
<h6><a id="momentary-alteration"></a>
Momentary Alteration [Spelltouched]
</h6>
You can briefly transform yourself into a second form, acquiring its
physical qualities.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#alter-self">alter self</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
Choose one specific form that you've turned yourself into with the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#alter-self">alter
self</a> spell. Once per day, you can use alter self as a spell-like ability
to turn yourself into this form for 1 minute.
</p>
<p><b>Special:</b>
You can gain Momentary Alteration multiple times. Each time you take the
feat, you can either extend the duration of an already chosen alternate
form by 1 minute or choose another specific form from among those you've
experienced after casting alter self on yourself.
</p>
<h6><a id="naturalized-denizen"></a>
Naturalized Denizen [spelltouched]
</h6>
You are unusually anchored to your location.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#dimensional-anchor">dimensional anchor</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
You are never treated as an extraplanar creature (and you lose the
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#extraplanar">extraplanar subtype</a>). Thus, you can't be affected by a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#banishment">banishment</a> or
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#dismissal">dismissal</a> spell or similar effects that send extraplanar creatures back to
their home planes.
</p>
<h6><a id="omniscient-whispers"></a>
Omniscient Whispers [Spelltouched]
</h6>
A constant, barely audible muttering echoes in your ears, usually beyond
your comprehension. But if you focus all your energy on listening, you
sometimes catch a sentence or two that bears directly on your current
situation.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#commune">commune</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#contact-other-plane">contact other plane</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
Once per week, you can tune into the voices you hear, getting the answer
to a question much as if you had asked it with a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#commune">commune</a> spell.
</p>
<p>
Using this feat renders you <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#exhausted">exhausted</a>.
</p>
<h6><a id="photosynthetic-skin"></a>
Photosynthetic Skin [Spelltouched]
</h6>
Your skin toughens when it draws energy from the sun.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#barkskin">barkskin</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
Whenever you're outside during the day, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your
natural armor (characters who don't have natural armor ordinarily have a
natural armor bonus of +0).
</p>
<h6><a id="polar-chill"></a>
Polar Chill [Spelltouched]
</h6>
You can call forth the cold of the arctic regions, making movement and
fighting difficult for the unprepared.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#cone-of-cold">cone of cold</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#ice-storm">ice storm</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
Once per day, you can make the ground icy in a 20-foot-radius spread
around you. Each square in that area becomes covered with ice, so it takes
two squares of movement to enter each square, and the DC of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#balance">Balance</a> and
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#tumble">Tumble</a> checks there increases by 5. A DC 10 Balance check is required to
run or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="specialAttacks.html#charge">charge</a> across the ice.
</p>
<p>
The ice remains for 1 minute or until exposed to fire.
</p>
<p>
You can't use this feat if you aren't touching the ground, and it doesn't
work if the air temperature is above 100 degrees.
</p>
<h6><a id="residual-rebound"></a>
Residual Rebound [Spelltouched]
</h6>
Sometimes spells cast at you rebound on the caster instead.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#spell-resistance">spell resistance</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#spell-turning">spell turning</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
If you roll a natural 20 on a save against a targeted spell, it turns back
on the caster as if affected by a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#spell-turning">spell turning</a> spell. Unlike spell
turning, however, the Residual Rebound feat potentially functions against
touch range spells as well. Residual Rebound only works on targeted spells
that allow a saving throw, so a
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsFtoG.html#fireball">fireball</a> won't rebound, nor will a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#power-word-stun">power word stun</a>.
</p>
<h6><a id="stench-of-the-dead"></a>
Stench of the Dead [spelltouched]
</h6>
The odor of decay hangs heavy on you, causing others to gasp and retch.
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>
Exposure to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsFtoG.html#ghoul-touch">ghoul touch</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#vampiric-touch">vampiric touch</a> spell.
</p>
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
You exude a carrion stench that causes any creature adjacent to you to
make a Fortitude
save (DC 12 + your Cha modifier) or become <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndCondition.html#sickened">sickened</a> as long as it
remains adjacent to you and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. You can't suppress
the stench voluntarily.
</p>
