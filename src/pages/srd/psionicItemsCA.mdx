its intended target.</p>
<a id="exhausting"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exhausting:</span> A cursed
item of this sort resembles a normal psionic item with a power that can
be freely activated, but it instead drains the user of power points
whenever he activates its power. </p>
<a id="subversive"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subversive:</span> A cursed
item of this sort appears identical to a standard psionic item.
However, it holds an inner malice for the wearer, whose saving throws
take a constant -2 penalty. The owner isn&#8217;t instantly aware of this
penalty but may become aware after a while, when it becomes clear that
he fails saves that others make with the same result on the saving
throw.</p>

reverse capacitor doesn&#8217;t store power points - it drains them, to the
surprise and chagrin of a psionic character taken in by its resemblance
to a cognizance crystal. Powers that identify psionic items incorrectly
identify a reverse capacitor as a cognizance crystal 50% of the time.</p>
<p>A psionic character attempting to use the power points
supposedly stored in a reverse capacitor instead loses 1d6 power points
per round for 7 rounds. A crackling arc connects the brow of the
character with the stone. If the character can put more than 40 feet
between himself and the reverse capacitor, the effect ends. If the
reverse capacitor drains more power points than the psionic character
possesses, the draining effect ends.</p>
<p>The drained power points are simply lost. Each new attempt to
use the power points supposedly stored in the reverse capacitor
initiates the draining effect anew.</p>

Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items, Instead, they are
psionic items that no longer can be made, at least by common mortal
means.

<a id="sutra-of-tranquil-thought"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sutra of Tranquil Thought:</span>
This monastic tome describes ancient techniques of mental focus and is
highly prized by psionic practitioners. If a psionic character who is
not evil studies the work during one week of solitary contemplation, he
gains 17 bonus power points and experience points sufficient to place
him halfway into the next level of experience. Those who use their
powers for evil are punished for their impertinence, losing 5d6 x 1,000
XP for defiling the book. In addition, an evil reader must make an
immediate DC 15 Will save or become permanently <a

measures can restore sanity.</p>
<p>The minds of nonpsionic beings are too clouded to benefit from
the secrets of this book. To anyone without psionic aptitude, the
book&#8217;s pages appear to contain nothing but elaborate patterns and
drawings of mysterious beings. Once it is read, the book vanishes into
the Astral Plane to an unknown destination. Even if it is found again,
the same character cannot benefit twice from perusing its contents.</p>

<a id="major-artifacts"></a><h5>Major Artifacts</h5>
Major artifacts are unique items - only one of each such item exists.
They are difficult to find and dangerous to handle, but once found, are
often even more difficult to destroy. A major psionic artifact has only
a single, specific means of destruction.

<a id="annulus"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Annulus:</span> This artifact
is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast
psionic power at bay, the Annulus is an artifact that any psionic being
should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and merely
finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes.</p>
<p>The Annulus is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material.
Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate
the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring
provide an adequate surface for grasping the item.</p>
<p>The Annulus has several powers, all of which require a wielder
to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first
grasped, knowledge of the artifact&#8217;s powers immediately flood the
wielder&#8217;s mind. The wielder can access all powers of the Annulus at
manifester level 20th.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Annulus generates a continuous <a
href="psionicPowersAtoC.html#catapsi" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">catapsi</a>
effect within a
100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is unaffected).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to
resist an effect that deals ability damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once per day, the wielder can trigger <a
href="psionicPowersQtoW.html#ultrablast"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">ultrablast</a> as a
standard action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can
trigger an effect similar to <a
href="psionicPowersDtoF.html#dimensional-anchor-psionic"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">psionic dimensional anchor</a> that
affects
all creatures in a 50-foot radius.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary power of the Annulus, however, is psionic
nullification. Once per year, the wielder can trigger this effect as a
special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous concentration to
complete. The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot
radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group
of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification
effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat, and sound from the
Annulus. Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are
nontargeted beings, but any psionic target - regardless of any
protection
it may possess - disintegrates in a terrific explosion. Nothing is left
but floating dust.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small
group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful being (such as a
demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the Annulus
to its limits. If it is used to nullify such a target, the artifact
succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by any
means.</p>
<a id="psicrown-of-the-crystal-mind"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psicrown of the Crystal Mind:</span>
An elaborate crystalline psicrown etched with strange designs, this
exceptional psicrown is so invested with power that it is considered an
artifact. </p>
<p>The power points in the Psicrown of the Crystal Mind can be
used to manifest any of the following powers at manifester level 20th
(or at the wearer&#8217;s manifester level if it is higher than 20th).</p>

<p>The wearer of the Psicrown of the Crystal Mind also gains
power resistance equal to 10 + his manifester level.</p>
<p>The Psicrown of the Crystal Mind has 1,000 power points when
discovered. Anyone who dons the crown instantly knows the number of
power points it has at the current time. The crown recharges itself,
gaining back 1 power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000
points.</p>
<p class="initial">As a special one-time use of the psicrown, the
wearer can
channel all the remaining charges in the psicrown into an uncontrolled
burst of energy. The wearer triggers this use as a standard action. All
within 20 feet of the wearer take hit points of damage equal to half
the power points left in the staff (Reflex DC 18 half). The wearer
inhabits a tiny eye of calm at the center of the destruction and is
unharmed, but the psicrown is reduced to a burned-out cinder. </p>
