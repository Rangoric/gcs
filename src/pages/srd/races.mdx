<p class="initial">A character&rsquo;s favored class doesn&rsquo;t count
against him or her when determining experience point penalties for
multiclassing.</p>
<h5><a id="race-and-languages"></a>RACE AND LANGUAGES</h5>
<p class="initial">All characters know how to speak Common. A
dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial
language, as appropriate. A character who has an Intelligence bonus at
1st level speaks other languages as well, one extra language per point
of Intelligence bonus as a starting character.</p>
<p><a id="literacy"></a><b>Literacy</b>: Any character except a barbarian can read and
write all the languages he or she speaks.</p>
<p><a id="class-related-languages"></a><b>Class-Related Languages</b>: Clerics, druids, and wizards
can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they&rsquo;re not on
the lists found in the race descriptions. These class-related languages
are as follows:
</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Cleric</i>: Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.</dd>
<dd><i>Druid</i>: Sylvan.</dd>
<dd><i>Wizard</i>: Draconic.</dd>

<h5><a id="small-characters"></a>SMALL CHARACTERS</h5>
<p class="initial">A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to
Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#hide" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Hide</a>

of a Medium character.</p>
<p>A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as
a Medium character.</p>
<p>A Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium
