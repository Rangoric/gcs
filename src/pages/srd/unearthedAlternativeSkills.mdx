ALTERNATIVE SKILL SYSTEMS
</h3>
When compared to the combat maneuvers and magical talents of the
characters in the game, the skill system often appears to run a distant
third in importance. It is, however, a detailed part of the d20 game
system and a place where you'll often spend a considerable amount of time
if you create detailed PCs, NPCs, or monsters to use in your game. The
variant skill systems discussed here eliminate some of the complexity of
the standard skill system, but at the expense of fewer opportunities for
customization.
<h5><a id="maximum-ranks-limited-choices"></a>
MAXIMUM RANKS, LIMITED CHOICES
</h5>
This variant skill system allows for some customization during character
creation and during character advancement. It allows for more up-front
choices and fewer down the road. In general, this system works for players
and game masters who want the versatility of the skill system but don't
want to worry about counting up every skill points and adjusting skills
every level. It's particularly useful for game masters who are creating
NPCs from scratch.
<p>
Essentially, this system treats each skill as either a known skill or an
unknown skill. A character is considered to have the maximum number of
ranks allowable in any skill known to that character, and no ranks in any
skill unknown to that character.
</p>

Learning Skills

<p>
Each character begins play knowing a number of skills equal to the number
of skill points his character would gain with each new class level. When
creating a character, choose a number of skills known based on your first
class level (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-skills-by-class">Table: Skills by Class</a>). Human characters add one to
their number of known skills.
</p>
<p>
For classes or monster types not listed on the table, simply assign a
number of skills known equal to the number of skill points gained at each
new level or Hit Dice, plus the character's or monsters intelligence
modifier.
</p>
<p>
Note whether each skill known is a class skill or cross-class skill for
your character, based on his starting class.

For example, Fnord the gnome bard has an Intelligence of 12 (+1 bonus) and
thus may know seven skills at 1st level. He selects the following seven
skills (and denotes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#forgery">Forgery</a> as a cross-class skill):
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> (string instruments),
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#use-magic-device">Use Magic Device</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#gather-information">Gather Information</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#listen">Listen</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#decipher-script">Decipher Script</a>, and
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#forgery">Forgery</a> (cc)</p>
<h6><a id="skill-modifiers"></a>
Skill Modifiers
</h6>
For each of your known skills, your modifier is calculated as if you had
the maximum number of ranks allowable in that skill. For a class skill,
the skill modifier is equal to your character level +3; for a cross-class
skill, the modifier is half that number, rounded down.
<p>
As with a normal skill
check, you also add any other modifiers that apply (racial bonuses,
ability modifiers, bonuses from synergy, and so forth).
</p>
<p>
For example, at 5th level, Fnord has a Charisma of 16 and a masterwork
lute. When he makes a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> (string instruments) check, he uses this
formula:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1d20 + 8 (class skill) + 3 (Cha modifier) + 1 (masterwork lute)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When he makes a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#forgery">Forgery</a> check, the formula changes to reflect the fact
that Forgery is a cross-class skill:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1d20 + 4 (cross-class skill) + 1 (Int modifier)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Skills that don't have ranks, such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#speak-language">Speak Language</a>, work differently. A
character who chooses Speak Language as a known skill learns four new
languages at 1st level and one new language at each level thereafter (if
Speak Language is a class skill) or two new languages at 1st level and one
new language at each odd-numbered level thereafter (if Speak Language is a
cross-class skill).
</p>
<h6><a id="prerequisites-and-minimum-skill-ranks"></a>
Prerequisites and Minimum Skill Ranks
</h6>
If you need to determine how many ranks your character has in a skill (for
purposes of meeting prerequisites for prestige class or feat requirements,
or for any other reason), simply assume you have the maximum number of
ranks you could have in any of the skills you know. For class skills,
that's always your character level +3, and for cross-class skills it's
half that total (rounded down).
<p>
For example, to use the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="bard.html#song-of-freedom">song of freedom</a> bardic music ability, Fnord must
be at least 12th level and have at least 15 ranks in a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> skill.
Since Perform is a class skill for bards, and Fnord has selected Perform
(string instruments) as one of his skills, he is treated as having the
maximum possible ranks in Perform (string instruments). Thus, by 12th
level, he is considered to have 15 ranks in Perform (string instruments).
At the same time, he is considered to have only 7 ranks in <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#forgery">Forgery</a> (a
cross-class skill).
</p>
<h6><a id="multiclass-characters"></a>
Multiclass Characters
</h6>
Multiclassing under this variant system is a little more complex than in
the normal rules and does not achieve the same results as single classing
would.
<p>
First, compare your current list of known skills to your new class's list
of class skills. If any of your new class's class skills are currently
known by you as cross-class skills, you may choose one such skill and
designate it as a class skill. This change immediately increases your
modifier for the chosen skill (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#skill-modifiers">Skill Modifiers</a>, above). Every time you
gain a level in this new class, you may choose another such skill, if
applicable, and change it from a cross-class skill to a class skill.
</p>
<p>
Second, compare your new class's number of skills known at 1st level to
the number of skills known 1st level from the class you already have. If
you already have more than one class, compare it to the class that would
grant the highest number of skills, even if that wasn't your first class.
For example, if you are playing a 2nd-level rogue/5th-level fighter and
pick up a level of barbarian, use the rogue's number of skills (8), even
though you have more fighter levels than rogue levels.
</p>
<p>
If your new class grants an equal or lower number of skills, you can
choose one skill from your new class's list to add to the skills you know
as a class skill. You immediately gain the new skill at the maximum
possible tank.
</p>
<p>
If your new class grants you up to four more skills than your best
previous class, you may choose two skills from your new class's list to
add to the skills you know as class skills. You immediately gain the two
new skills at the maximum possible rank.
</p>
<p>
If your new class grants you five or more skills over and above your best
class, you may choose three skills from your new class's list to add to
the skills you know as class skills. You immediately gain the three new
skills at the maximum possible rank.
</p>
<p>
Perform this operation every time you gain 1st level in a new class.
</p>
<p>
This system reflects the idea that by multiclassing, you learn more
abilities and, in particular, skills. Most characters do end up with
higher numbers of skills and ranks if they multiclass under this variant
system, but they still have fewer skill choices.
</p>
<h6><a id="learning-new-skills"></a>
Learning New Skills
</h6>
If you are not interested in multiclassing but wish to learn new skills
anyway, you have two options.
<p>
If you increase your Intelligence modifier, you learn one additional
skill. Make this skill choice using the class skill list of any of your
existing classes. You can choose a class skill or a cross-class skill.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, your game master can allow the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#skill-knowledge">Skill Knowledge</a> feat, which increases your
characters number of known skills.
</p>
<h5><a id="level-based-skills"></a>
LEVEL-BASED SKILLS
</h5>
This even simpler variant system assumes that skills are much less
important in your game and that you really don't want to be bothered with
tracking or even looking for skill ranks over the course
of a fast-paced game session.
<h6><a id="making-skill-checks"></a>
Making Skill Checks
</h6>
Under this system, characters do not normally acquire skill ranks or track skill
points at all. Each character has a list of known skills that includes all
his class skills (from all classes).
<p>
When a character makes a skill check under this
variant skill system, use these formulas:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Class Skills:</b> 1d20 + character level + modifiers
</p>
<p>
<b>Cross-Class Skills:</b> 1d20 + modifiers
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the trade-off for simplicity is ability. Characters with a large
number of class skills are extremely versatile, but even their average
skill check result
is lower than that made by a character using the existing skill system.
For skills outside their areas of expertise (cross-class skills), they
have nothing beyond their own basic abilities and perhaps magic or other
bonuses.
</p>
<p>
Under this system, all barbarians are good at climbing, jumping,
listening, riding, and the like, but have virtually no ability to bluff,
hide, search, or perform other cross-class tasks. Monks become superior
acrobats (with talent in balancing, climbing, jumping, and tumbling) but
no proficiency at anything outside the idiom of the typical monk (such as
disguise or survival).
</p>
<p>
A character who wishes to specialize or branch out her skill knowledge can
still select feats such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#skill-focus">Skill Focus</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#alertness">Alertness</a>, and the like,
regardless of whether the skills affected by the feat are class skills or
cross-class skills. This is the best avenue for a fighter who wishes to
improve his awareness, a wizard who wants to become intimidating, and so
on.
</p>
<p>
Skills that don't have ranks, such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#speak-language">Speak Language</a>, work differently. A
character who has Speak Language as a class skill learns four new
languages at 1st level and one new language at each level thereafter.
Characters without Speak Language as a class skill can't learn new
languages without selecting the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#skill-knowledge">Skill Knowledge</a> feat and designating Speak
Language as a class skill.
</p>
<h6><a id="multiclassing"></a>
Multiclassing
</h6>
Since skills are not as important in a game that uses this system (at
least, that's the intention), when a character multiclasses, combine the
skill lists. Consider all skills on both lists as class skills.
<h6><a id="learning-new-level-based-skills"></a>
Learning New Skills
</h6>
As with the maximum ranks variant described earlier, the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#skill-knowledge">Skill Knowledge</a>
feat (see below) can be selected by a character to add to his number of
skills known. In this case, the feat only allows you to designate a
cross-class skill as a class skill (since you already know all your class
skills).
<h5><a id="skill-knowledge"></a>
SkILL KNOWLEDGE [GENERAL]
</h5>
You gain access to new knowledge and abilities.
<p><b>Benefit:</b> Choose any two skills from one of your current classes' skill lists. You
now know these skills as class skills.
</p>
<p><b>Special:</b> Instead of choosing two class skills, you may choose one cross-class skill
(whether you already know it or not) and learn it, treating it as a class
skill from that point forward.
</p>
