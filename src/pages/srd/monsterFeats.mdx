<a id="monster-feats"></a><h2>Monster Feats</h2>
<p class="initial">These feats apply to abilities most commonly
found amongst monsters or are related to monsters.</p>
<h5><a id="ability-focus"></a>ABILITY FOCUS [GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial">Choose one of the creature&rsquo;s special
attacks.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Special attack.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against
the special attack on which the creature focuses.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A creature can gain this feat multiple times.
Its effects do not stack. Each time the creature takes the feat it
applies to a different special attack.</p>
<h5><a id="awesome-blow"></a>AWESOME BLOW [GENERAL, FIGHTER]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Str 25, Power Attack,
Improved Bull Rush, size Large or larger.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: As a standard action, the creature may choose
to subtract 4 from its melee attack roll and deliver an awesome blow.
If the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an
awesome blow, its opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = damage
dealt) or be knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking
creature&rsquo;s choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can only
push
the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&rsquo;t move
closer to
the attacking creature than the square it started in. If an obstacle
prevents the completion of the opponent&rsquo;s move, the opponent and
the
obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the
space adjacent to the obstacle.</p>
<h5><a id="craft-construct"></a>CRAFT CONSTRUCT [ITEM CREATION]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, Craft Wondrous Item.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: A creature with this feat can create any
construct whose prerequisites it meets. Enchanting a construct takes
one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To enchant a construct,
a spellcaster must spend 1/25 the item&rsquo;s price in XP and use up
raw
materials costing half of this price (see individual construct monster
entries for details).</p>
<p>A creature with this feat can repair constructs that have
taken damage. In one day of work, the creature can repair up to 20
points of damage by expending 50 gp per point of damage repaired.</p>
<p>A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit
Dice.</p>
<h5><a id="empower-spell-like-ability"></a>EMPOWER SPELL-LIKE
ABILITY [GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Spell-like ability at
caster level 6th or higher.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Choose one of the creature&rsquo;s spell-like
abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that
ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or
less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>
<p>When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all
variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by
one half. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like
abilities without random variables are not affected.</p>
<p>The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating
a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round
down) &ndash;2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the
Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat. </p>
<p><b>Special</b>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each
time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its
spell-like abilities.</p>
<h5><a id="flyby-attack"></a>FLYBY ATTACK [GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Fly speed.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: When flying, the creature can take a move
action (including a dive) and another standard action at any point
during the move. The creature cannot take a second move action during a
round when it makes a flyby attack.</p>
<p><b>Normal</b>: Without this feat, the creature takes a
standard action either before or after its move.</p>
<h5><a id="hover"></a>HOVER [GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Fly speed.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: When flying, the creature can halt its forward
motion and hover in place as a move action. It can then fly in any
direction, including straight down or straight up, at half speed,
regardless of its maneuverability.</p>
<p>If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in place
for the turn and take a full-round action. A hovering creature cannot
make wing attacks, but it can attack with all other limbs and
appendages it could use in a full attack. The creature can instead use
a breath weapon or cast a spell instead of making physical attacks, if
it could normally do so.</p>
<p>If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet of
the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its
wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds
so generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and
other small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the
cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 to 20
feet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total
concealment (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate
the creature).</p>
<p>Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a <a
href="skillsAll.html#concentration" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Concentration</a>
check (DC 10 + 1/2 creature&rsquo;s HD) to cast a spell.</p>
<p><b>Normal</b>: Without this feat, a creature must keep moving
while flying unless it has perfect maneuverability.</p>
<h5><a id="improved-natural-armor"></a>IMPROVED NATURAL ARMOR
[GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Natural armor, Con 13.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: The creature&rsquo;s natural armor bonus
increases
by 1.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A creature can gain this feat multiple times.
Each time the creature takes the feat its natural armor bonus increases
by another point.</p>
<h5><a id="improved-natural-attack"></a>IMPROVED NATURAL ATTACK
[GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Natural weapon, base
attack bonus +4.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Choose one of the creature&rsquo;s natural
attack
forms. The damage for this natural weapon increases by one step, as if
the creature&rsquo;s size had increased by one category: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4,
1d6,
1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6. </p>
<p>A weapon or attack that deals 1d10 points of damage increases
as follows: 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8, 6d8, 8d8, 12d8.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: A creature can gain this feat multiple times.
Each time it applies to a different natural attack.
</p>
<h5><a id="multiattack"></a>MULTIATTACK [GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Three or more natural
attacks.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: The creature&rsquo;s secondary attacks with
natural
weapons take only a &ndash;2 penalty.</p>
<p><b>Normal</b>: Without this feat, the creature&rsquo;s
secondary
attacks with natural weapons take a &ndash;5 penalty.</p>
<h5><a id="multiweapon-fighting"></a>MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING
[GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 13, three or more
hands.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons
are reduced by 2 with the primary hand and reduced by 6 with off hands.</p>
<p><b>Normal</b>: A creature without this feat takes a &ndash;6
penalty
on attacks made with its primary hand and a &ndash;10 penalty on
attacks made
with its off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the others are
off hands.) See Two-Weapon Fighting.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Fighting
feat for creatures with more than two arms.</p>
<h5><a id="quicken-spell-like-ability"></a>QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE
ABILITY [GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Spell-like ability at
caster level 10th or higher.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Choose one of the creature&rsquo;s spell-like
abilities, subject to the restrictions described below. The creature
can use that ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per
day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per
day).</p>
Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not
provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another
action&mdash;including the use of another spell-like ability&mdash;in
the same
round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use
only one quickened spell-like ability per round.
<p>The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating
a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round
down) &ndash;4. For a summary, see the table below.</p>
<p>In addition, a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with
a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.</p>
<p><b>Normal</b>: Normally the use of a spell-like ability
requires a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless
noted otherwise.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each
time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its
spell-like abilities.</p>

<h5><a id="snatch"></a>SNATCH [GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Size Huge or larger.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>: The creature can choose to start a grapple
when it hits with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the improved
grab special attack. If the creature gets a hold on a creature three or
more sizes smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic bite or claw
damage. A snatched opponent held in the creature&rsquo;s mouth is not
allowed
a Reflex save against the creature&rsquo;s breath weapon, if it has one.</p>
<p>The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a free
action or use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature
travels 1d6 x 10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet
traveled. If the creature flings a snatched opponent while flying, the
opponent takes this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.</p>
<h5><a id="wingover"></a>WINGOVER [GENERAL]</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Fly speed.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>: A flying creature with this feat can change
direction quickly once each round as a free action. This feat allows it
to turn up to 180 degrees regardless of its maneuverability, in
addition to any other turns it is normally allowed. A creature cannot
gain altitude during a round when it executes a wingover, but it can
dive.</p>
<p>The change of direction consumes 10 feet of flying movement.</p>
