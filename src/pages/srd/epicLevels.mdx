Epic characters-those whose character level is 21st or higher-are
handled slightly differently from nonepic characters. While epic
characters continue to receive most of the benefits of gaining levels,
some benefits are replaced by alternative gains. A class can be
advanced beyond 20th level.&nbsp; A ten-level prestige class can
progress beyond 10th level, but only if the character level is already
20th or higher.&nbsp; A class with fewer than ten levels cannot
progress beyond the maximum for that class, regardless of character
level.



<a id="epic-save-bonus"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Epic Save Bonus:</span> A
character&#8217;s base save bonus does not increase after character level
reaches 20th. However, the character does receive a cumulative +1 epic
bonus on all saving throws at every even-numbered level beyond 20th, as
shown on Table: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonuses. Any time a feat,
prestige class, or other rule refers to your base save bonus, use the
sum of your base save bonus and epic save bonus.



<a id="epic-attack-bonus"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Epic Attack Bonus:</span>
Similarly, the character&#8217;s base attack bonus does not increase after
character level reaches 20th. However, the character does receive a
cumulative +1 epic bonus on all attacks at every odd-numbered level
beyond 20th, as shown on Table: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonuses. Any
time a feat, prestige class, or other rule refers to your base attack
bonus (except for gaining additional attacks), use the sum of your base attack bonus and epic attack bonus.



<a id="class-skill-max-ranks"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Class Skill Max Ranks:</span>
The maximum number of ranks a character can have in a class skill is
equal to his or her character level +3. 



<a id="cross-class-skill-max-ranks"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cross-Class Skill Max Ranks:</span>
For cross-class skills, the maximum number of ranks is one-half the
maximum for a class skill. 

<a id="feats"></a><b>Feats:</b> Every character gains one feat (which may be an epic or nonepic
feat at the player&#8217;s choice) at every level divisible by three. These
feats are in addition to any bonus feats granted in the class
descriptions. 

<a id="ability-increase"></a><b>Ability Increases:</b> Upon gaining any level divisible by four, a
character increases one of his or her ability scores by 1 point. The
player chooses which ability score to improve. For multiclass
characters, feats and ability increases are gained according to
character level, not class level.

<a id="class-features"></a><h5>CLASS FEATURES</h5>
Many, but not all, class features continue to accumulate after 20th
level. The following guidelines describe how the epic class
progressions. 



<ul>
<li>A character continues to gain Hit Dice and skill points as
normal beyond 20th level.</li>
<li>Generally, any class feature that uses class level as part
of a
mathematical formula continues to increase using the character&#8217;s class
level in the formula.&nbsp; Any prestige class feature that calculates
a
save DC using the class level should add only half the character&#8217;s
class levels above 10th.</li>
<li>For spellcasters, caster level continues to increase after
20th level.
However, spells per day don&#8217;t increase after 20th level. The only way
to gain additional spells per day (other than the bonus spells gained
from a high ability score) is to select the Improved Spell Capacity
epic feat.</li>
<li>The powers of familiars, special mounts, and fiendish
servants continue to increase as their masters gain levels. </li>
<li>Any class features that increase or accumulate as part of a
repeated
pattern also continues to increase or accumulate after 20th level at
the same rate.&nbsp; An exception to this rule is any bonus feat
granted as
a class feature. If a character gets bonus feats as part of a class
feature, these do not increase with epic levels. Instead, these classes
get bonus feats at a different rate (described in each epic class
description).</li>
<li>In addition to the class features retained from nonepic
levels, each
class gains a bonus feat every two, three, four, or five levels after
20th. This augments each class&#8217;s progression of class features, because
not all classes otherwise improve class features after 20th level. A
character must select these feats from the list of bonus feats for that
class. These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that every
character gets every three levels. The character isn&#8217;t limited to
selecting from the class list when selecting these feats.</li>
<li>Characters don&#8217;t gain any new class features, because there
aren&#8217;t any
new class features described for these levels. Class features with a
progression that slows or stops before 20th level and features that
have a limited list of options do not improve as a character gains epic
levels. Likewise, class features that are gained only at a single level
do not improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, class features that are gained only at a single
level do not improve.</p>
<a id="adding-a-second-class"></a><h6>Adding a Second Class</h6>
When a single-class epic character gains a level, he or she may choose
to increase the level of his or her current class or pick up a new
class at 1st level. The standard rules for multiclass characters still
apply, but epic characters must keep in mind the rules for epic
advancement. The epic character gains all the 1st-level class skills,
weapon proficiency, armor proficiency, spells, and other class features
of the new class, as well as a Hit Die of the appropriate type. In
addition, the character gets the usual skill points from the new class.
Just as with standard multiclassing, adding the second class does not
confer some of the benefits for a 1st-level character, including
maximum hit points from the first Hit Die, quadruple the per-level
skill points, starting equipment, starting gold, or an animal
companion. An epic character does not gain the base attack bonuses and
base save bonuses normally gained when adding a second class. Instead,
an epic character uses the epic attack bonus and epic save bonus
progression shown on Table: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonus. Whenever
an epic character is allowed to pick up a feat as part of character
level advancement, he or she can choose either a nonepic feat or an
epic feat. All class descriptions provide a list of bonus feats that
characters must choose from. When a character has to choose from a list
of bonus feats in the second class, he or she can also choose from the
bonus epic feats described for each specific class.
