TEST-BASED PREREQUISITES
</h3>
Prestige classes and feats use traditional d20 prerequisites: skill ranks, specific
feats, and other game statistics. But the master of the assassins� guild
doesn�t really know whether you have 4 ranks in the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#disguise">Disguise</a> skill. He�d
be at least as impressed with your ability to disguise yourself if you had
a sky-high Charisma, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#skill-focus">Skill Focus</a> (Disguise) and 5 ranks in <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a>, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="magicItemsWI.html#hat-of-disguise">hat of
disguise</a>, or the supernatural ability to change shape (possessed by the
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersDitoDo.html#doppelganger">doppelganger</a> and the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersOtoR.html#rakshasa">rakshasa</a>, among others). Similarly, no one in the
game world can tell whether a potential <a style="color: #579eb6" href="dwarvenDefender.html">dwarven defender</a> has the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#toughness">Toughness</a>
feat or not. Prerequisites that rely on game statistics rather than
visible �realities� of the game world can break the verisimilitude of the
world in your imagination.
<p>
To make prerequisites seem more �real,� this variant changes them to
actual tests that would be observable in the game world. The assassins�
guild, for example, might require potential members to sneak past the
castle guards (employing <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillAll.html#hide">Hide</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#move-silently">Move Silently</a>), infiltrate the queen�s
banquet (using <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#disguise">Disguise</a>), and poison the wine of a minor noble (thus
killing someone for no other reason than to join the assassins). It
certainly helps to have 4 ranks in Disguise and 8 ranks each in Hide and
Move Silently, but the observable result is what the assassins judge.
</p>
<p>
Test-based prerequisites have two big advantages. First, they encourage
character variety and player cleverness. Any PC who wants to become an
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="arcaneArcher.html">arcane archer</a> can dream up a dozen ways to gain an edge in the �Twelve
Arrow Challenge� competition, and maybe he succeeds even if he has a base
attack bonus of only +5. It�s entirely arbitrary to keep out a would-be
arcane archer who has a Dexterity of 20 but accept an archer with a
Dexterity of 13 and the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> (longbow) feat. The first character
is a much better archer, and the prestige class should recognize that. The
second advantage to test-based prerequisites is that they help immerse the
player in the game world. It�s more exciting if a would-be <a style="color: #579eb6" href="hierophant.html">hierophant�s</a>
goal is �I want to earn a Pact with the Heavens� rather than �I need 15
ranks in <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion).�
</p>
<p>
Because the existence of a test implies that there�s an NPC administering
the test, these new prerequisites work best if the prestige classes in
your campaign are tied to specific organizations. For feats, test-based
prerequisites work best if PCs must train as described in the DMG (and
thus find an instructor) to get new feats.
</p>
<p>
Employing test-based prerequisites means that a character taking a test
spends some time at the gaming table trying to earn access to the prestige
class or feat. If a test is elaborate or timeconsuming, the other players
at the game table might get bored. A short single-player session before or
after the main game session is often a good way to take care of a test.
Another risk with a test-based prerequisite is that it relies at least to
a degree on the fall of the dice. If a player with her heart set on
becoming a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="loremaster.html">loremaster</a> has a run of bad luck during the Examination of
Ineffable Lore, she might resent the extra obstacle you�ve placed in her
character�s way. Conversely, a lucky set of die rolls can potentially give
a PC access to a prestige class or feat much earlier than would otherwise
be possible.
</p>
<h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-test-based-prerequisites"></a>
BEHIND THE CURTAIN: TEST-BASED PREREQUISITES
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">
So why don�t all prestige classes employ test-based prerequisites? It�s a
matter of control that highlights a fundamental difference between the job
of the game designer and the job of the GM. The d20 rules use the
prerequisites they do because they�re based on predictable numbers. No
character can have a base attack bonus higher than her character level,
for example, or more ranks in a skill than her character level + 3. For
the game designer, that predictability is an important balancing tool,
ensuring that no character gets access to a prestige class or feat so
early that it makes the game less fun.
<p>
But as the GM, you don�t have to have to worry about millions of possible
characters, just the specific ones in your campaign. You can predict your
players better than anyone else, both in terms of what appeals to them and
what means they use to achieve those ends. And you are the architect of
the game world. If a PC becomes an <a style="color: #579eb6" href="eldritchKnight.html">eldritch knight</a> by �cheating� on the
entrance test, the knights might kick him out and update their test to
close the loophole � just as a real-world organization would.
</p></div>
<h5><a id="pretige-class-tests"></a>
PRESTIGE CLASS TESTS
</h5>
The following tests are examples of test-based prerequisites for the
standard prestige classes. Because this variant relies heavily on the
guiding hand of the GM, these tests won�t be appropriate in all campaigns.
<p><b><a id="arcane-archer"></a><a style="color: black" href="arcaneArcher.html">Arcane Archer</a>:</b>
The Test of the Twelve Arrows. The applicant must cast magic weapon on the
provided bow, then take twelve +1 arrows into a specially tended part of
the forest. Before night falls, she must slay a wild boar, use magic to
capture an owl, and bring down the albino stag without hitting any of the
other stags in the herd. The applicant fails if the tasks aren�t completed
by nightfall or if she runs out of arrows.
</p>
<p><b><a id="arcane-trickster"></a><a style="color: black" href="arcaneTrickster.html">Arcane Trickster</a>:</b>
Fleece the Police. First, the applicant must intentionally get arrested
for unlawful magic use, displaying his flashiest spells while the arcane
tricksters watch him surreptitiously. That night in jail, the applicant
receives a confusing, seemingly contradictory map, which he must figure
out (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#decipher-script">Decipher Script</a> DC 17). The relevant parts of the map show the layout
of the precinct building. If the applicant can escape, he is welcomed into
the ranks of the arcane tricksters. This test is made more difficult by
the fact that the guards take away all the applicant�s gear.
</p>
<p><b><a id="archmage"></a><a style="color: black" href="archmage.html">Archmage</a>:</b>
The Counterspell Test of Sol'atur. An archmage visits the applicant
unannounced and proposes a counterspell battle. The archmage casts 5th-,
6th-, and 7th-level spells from all eight schools, and the applicant must
successfully identify and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="magicOverview.html#counterspelling">counter</a> as many as he can. To be accepted among
the archmages, the applicant must have a perfect score on identification
and must successfully counter at least one 7th-level spell and one spell
from each of at least five different schools.
</p>
<p><b><a id="assassin"></a><a style="color: black" href="assassin.html">Assassin</a>:</b>
The Test of <i>Theku et Rhasett</i>��Eliminate, then replace.� Contacted by an
anonymous letter, the applicant is given the name of a well-known
functionary in the noble court, often the chamberlain, troubadour, or
court wizard. The applicant must sneak into the castle on the night of the
full moon, kill the target, and then impersonate him. The test is a
success if the applicant walks out of the castle disguised as the target
when the gates open in the morning, carrying the target�s head in a
satchel.
</p>
<p><b><a id="blackguard"></a><a style="color: black" href="blackguard.html">Blackguard</a>:</b>
Break the Weapon, Bind the Contract. Below the palace is a chamber
forgotten by most: the prison of Thazill, a bearded devil of unsurpassed
evil. A would-be applicant must slip past the clay golem that wanders the
prison complex and convince Thazill to agree to a nonlethal duel. Thazill
is fascinated with questions of mortal faith, so even a basic
understanding of religion (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> [religion] DC 12) impresses him
greatly. Thazill wields a glaive, and anyone who can break it has earned
the right to call himself a blackguard.
</p>
<p><b><a id="dragon-disciple"></a><a style="color: black" href="dragonDisciple.html">Dragon Disciple</a>:</b>
Ritual of Essence Distillation. Fundamentally, becoming a dragon disciple
is a question of heritage. But a ritual exists that, when performed
properly, can awaken the blood of one�s draconic heritage. Performing the
12-hour ritual requires the ability to speak Draconic and a successful DC
18 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) check. At three points during the ritual, the
applicant must release some of his stored magical energy (expend a spell
slot, in other words).
</p>
<p><b><a id="duelist"></a><a style="color: black" href="duelist.html">Duelist</a>:</b>
Crossed Swords at Noon. This one�s simple � to become a duelist, you have to
beat an existing duelist in a fair duel before a crowd in the town square.
But the duelists are in on a secret that the applicant usually isn�t: The
battle may be won with blades, but the duelists are judging the
applicant�s worthiness based on the acclaim of the crowd. The battle is to
surrender, not death, and the NPC duelist surrenders when reduced to
one-third of her hit points or less.
</p>
<p><b><a id="dwarven-defender"></a><a style="color: black" href="dwarvenDefender.html">Dwarven Defender</a>:</b>
The Tunnel of Implacable Stone. The dwarven defenders take the applicant
deep into the bowels of the earth, give him his weapon of choice (but no
other gear), and order him to start a timed run up a steeply sloping
tunnel to the surface. Along the way, he faces a series of fights with
progressively larger <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#earth-elemental">earth elementals</a>, but after each fight, he earns a
piece of equipment: first armor, then a shield, then perhaps a healing
potion, and so on. Between fights, the applicant must run uphill, striving
for the surface. If he survives the fights with the elementals and makes
it out of the tunnel in time, he becomes a dwarven defender.
</p>
<p><b><a id="eldritch-knight"></a><a style="color: black" href="eldritchKnight.html">Eldritch Knight</a>:</b>
Tourney of the Grand Eagle. Every year, the eldritch knights have a
two-day tournament in a tent city they magically create outside the city
walls. On the first day, applicants go through an archery contest, a duel
with swords, and another duel using a melee weapon of each applicant�s
choosing. (The duels are to unconsciousness, and clerics are on hand to
heal the gravely wounded.) On the second day, applicants engage in a
series of spellcasting duels � everything from fights between summoned
monsters to games of counter spelling one-upsmanship. Using a complex
scoring system, the eldritch knights select two applicants to join their
order at sunset of the second day.
</p>
<p><b><a id="hierophant"></a><a style="color: black" href="hierophant.html">Hierophant</a>:</b>
Pact with the Heavens (or Depths). First, the would-be hierophant calls an
outsider allied with his faith (traditionally by means of an <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#extend-spell">extended</a>
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#lesser-planar-ally">lesser planar ally</a> spell). The ally tests the applicant�s knowledge of his
religion (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> [religion] DC 25) and asks for a demonstration of the
applicant�s spellcasting potency. If the ally is impressed, it intercedes
on the applicant�s behalf, and the new hierophant receives an indisputable
sign of his deity�s favor.
</p>
<p><b><a id="horizon-walker"></a><a style="color: black" href="horizonWalker.html">Horizon Walker</a>:</b>
The Red Lodge. The test for entrance to the horizon walkers is simple:
find the door to the clubhouse. The Red Lodge isn�t exactly secret � clues
to its location are scattered across dozens of maps � but it�s located in a
remote wilderness location and magically protected against divinations and
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#teleport">teleport</a> spells. The applicant has to learn where the Red Lodge is, then
get there under her own power.
</p>
<p><b><a id="loremaster"></a><a style="color: black" href="loremaster.html">Loremaster</a>:</b>
Examination of Ineffable Lore. To become a loremaster, an applicant must
first impress the existing loremasters by giving them either a magic item
or an original spell that the applicant created herself. Then the
loremasters pose a question or riddle of unsurpassed difficulty, which the
applicant has one game month to solve. It�s an open-book, open-magic
test � without restrictions on the means the applicant may use to solve the
riddle posed by the loremasters. When the applicant returns with the
correct answer, the loremasters reveal that they didn�t know the answer
themselves, then congratulate the applicant on her original contribution
to their accumulated store of knowledge.
</p>
<p><b><a id="mystic-theurge"></a><a style="color: black" href="mysticTheurge.html">Mystic Theurge</a>:</b>
Journey of the Two Tests. The applicant must travel to a far-off city to
study at a particular arcanists� college, passing their examination with a
DC 16 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) check. Then the applicant goes to the
mountain-top Citadel of the Theurges, where he meditates and learns from
the priests there. Finally, he receives a divine vision in which a
representative of his deity or alignment questions him about matters
of faith (answering correctly requires a DC 16 Knowledge [religion]
check).
</p>
<p><b><a id="shadowdancer"></a><a style="color: black" href="shadowdancer.html">Shadowdancer</a>:</b>
Audition in Darkness. On a dimly lit stage in an abandoned theater, the
applicant must dance well enough to impress the judges sitting unseen in
the audience (a DC 15 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> [dance] check). Even if she passes the dance
audition, she hears a cry of �Get her!� and dozens of guards rush the
stage. She must escape the labyrinthine theater any way she can, employing
stealth and combat prowess. She isn�t allowed to attack the guards
directly, but she can make ripostes (attacks of opportunity, in other
words) if she gets the chance. If she gets out of the theater, she�s
welcomed into the troupe of shadowdancers with a great revel.
</p>
<p><b><a id="thaumaturgist"></a><a style="color: black" href="thaumaturgist.html">Thaumaturgist</a>:</b>
Duel of the Servants. After calling a planar ally, the would-be
thaumaturgist visits the vine-covered ruins of an ancient temple. A
high-level thaumaturgist meets the applicant and his ally there, then
begins casting his own <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#lesser-planar-ally">lesser planar ally</a> spell. During the 10 minutes it
takes the thaumaturgist to cast his spell, the applicant can cast whatever
spells he wishes on his own planar ally. Then the allies of the
thaumaturgist and the applicant battle. The thaumaturgist�s ally yields
when reduced to 20% or less of its full normal hit points. If the
applicant�s ally wins, he�s eligible to join the ranks of the
thaumaturgists.
</p>

<h5><a id="feat-tests"></a>
FEAT TESTS
</h5>
The tests described below are examples of what an instructor might demand
from a PC before teaching a particular feat. As with the prestige class
tests above, they won�t be appropriate for all campaigns.
<p>
Not every feat with a prerequisite has a test associated with it, because
many of the requirements are either very simple (base attack bonus of +1,
for example), or they are tied to a specific tree of feats (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#power-attack">Power Attack</a>
is a prerequisite for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#cleave">Cleave</a>, for example). The best candidates for feat
tests are feats at the top of their respective feat trees (those that have
other feats as prerequisites but are not themselves prerequisites) and
feats available only to higher-level characters, because those feats
represent specialized training that only the most accomplished can hope to
complete.
</p>
<p><b><a id="great-cleave"></a><a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#great-cleave">Great Cleave</a>:</b>
Test of the Death-Dealer. The applicant must run headlong into battle
against a numerically superior foe (often goblins, kobolds, or low-level
soldiers), using his <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#cleave">Cleave</a> feat in 3 consecutive rounds and dropping a
second foe on at least two of those occasions. That performance
sufficiently impresses the instructor, who offers to teach the applicant
Great Cleave.
</p>
<p><b><a id="greater-two-weapon-fighting"></a><a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#greater-two-weapon-fighting">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</a>:</b>
Tempest of Steel. The applicant must deal at least 6 points of damage to
each of five gladiators (AC 13), all in the same round.
</p>
<p><b><a id="greater-weapon-focus-and-greater-weapon-specialization"></a>
<a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#greater-weapon-focus">Greater Weapon Focus</a> and <a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#greater-weapon-specialization">Greater Weapon Specialization</a>:</b>

Seek the Master. The applicant must find a reputed master of her chosen
weapon, then survive for 5 rounds in a duel against the master. The master
sets the conditions of the duel, which can be safe or deadly, depending on
the alignment and inclination
of the master.
</p>
<p><b><a id="improved-critical"></a><a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#improved-critical">Improved Critical</a>:</b>
Anatomists� Examination. The trainer sets up an array of cadavers or
butcher�s meat swinging from ropes. The applicant must strike each one a
single time, aiming for a particularly vulnerable point (AC 20). The
trainer accepts any applicants who can hit at least six of the targets
over the course of 4 rounds. Magic weapons aren�t allowed.
</p>
<p><b><a id="improved-precise-shot"></a><a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#imrpoved-precise-shot">Improved Precise Shot</a>:</b>
Test of the Shield Maiden. The applicant must hit an elusive, armored
target (AC 24 because it�s using the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="actionsInCombat.html#total-defence">total defense</a> action) without hitting
the shield-wielding assistant who stands between the applicant and the
target. The applicant gets three chances and must hit with two. Magic
weapons and ammunition aren�t allowed.
</p>
<p><b><a id="manyshot"></a><a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#manyshot">Manyshot</a>:</b>
Attack the Caravan. The applicant must hit seven out of nine bullseye
targets (AC 18) mounted on the back of wagons 30 feet away, and she has
only 3 rounds to do so. Any sort of magical assistance is acceptable,
except for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#haste">haste</a> spells and weapons with the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="magicItemsAW.html#speed">speed</a> special ability.
</p>
<p><b><a id="shoot-on-the-run"></a><a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#shoot-on-the-run">Shot on the Run</a>:</b>
Gauntlet of Cudgels. The applicant must move down the middle of a 120-foot
long path lined on both sides with cudgel-wielding soldiers. At the end of
the path is a target (AC 10), which the applicant must hit with four
arrows or other projectiles before 30 seconds pass. Magic weapons and
ammunition aren�t allowed.
</p>
<p><b><a id="snatch-arrows"></a><a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#snatch-arrows">Snatch Arrows</a>:</b>
Become the Bullseye. The applicant must stand in one spot as an archer
shoots ten arrows at him, one per round. He must successfully deflect at
least half of the arrows (and survive the damage from the rest).
</p>
<p><b><a id="whirlwind-attack"></a><a style="color: black" href="featsAll.html#whirlwind-attack">Whirlwind Attack</a>:</b>
Warrior Unscathed. The instructor surrounds herself with four assistants
in the center of the dojo. The applicant must successfully hit the
instructor three times with <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#spring-attack">spring attacks</a> without suffering so much as a
scratch from the instructor or her assistants. (Most applicants opt to
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="actionsInCombat.html#fight-defensively">fight defensively</a> and use <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#combat-expertise">Combat Expertise</a> to improve their Armor Class.)
</p>
<h5><a id="designing-your-own-tests"></a>
DESIGNING YOUR OWN TESTS
</h5>
The tests described above tend to reward the same feats, ability scores,
and other character aspects that standard prerequisites do. That�s a
useful starting point for tests you might design based on published
prestige classes or high-level feats: Imagine what kinds of activities
would be significantly easier for characters who possess the relevant feat
or other attribute defined as a prerequisite.
<p>
For prestige classes based on organizations you�ve designed yourself, you
have a lot more freedom. Answer this question: What would impress the
leader of the organization enough to offer membership? Then construct a
test just as the leader would, making it hard enough to keep membership
fairly exclusive. Consider how applicants might bend or break the rules of
the test � both as the leader and as the GM. Anything the leader would
reasonably anticipate works its way into the rules of the test. If you see
a potential �cheat� that the leader of the organization wouldn�t
anticipate, then either design a completely different test or leave the
loophole open � whichever is more likely to lead to an interesting story.
</p>
<p>
Try to keep tests fairly simple, because they�re essentially solo affairs.
You don�t want to leave the rest of the PCs waiting impatiently while one
character works his way through a test. As an exception, you can design a
test so complex or difficult that the relevant PC can�t complete it
alone � the rest of the PCs must help, and completing the test becomes a
full-fledged adventure. This technique works best when partnered with
other rewards (usually treasure or the chance to do a good deed or settle
an old score) for the PCs who aren�t taking a test.
</p>
<p>
For example, you could design a multiple-part riddle for a would-be
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="loremaster.html">loremaster</a> that takes the PCs from the city to an ancient, ruined temple,
then to a planar city where they must bargain with an <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersG.html#efreeti">efreeti</a> lord.
The wizard PC gets the chance to become a loremaster, the cleric PC can
reclaim the temple for his deity, the rogue gets a chance to sneak into
the treasure vaults of the efreet, and the fighter gets out of the city,
where he�s wanted for a murder he didn�t commit. Everyone has a motivation
to help the wizard with her riddle.
</p>
