<p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Caster level 3rd.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or

caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question
and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its
spell level x its caster level x 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must
spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing
one half this base price.</p>
<p>When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would
normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the
target of the spell.</p>

component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition
to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material
component or pay the XP when creating the potion.</p>
