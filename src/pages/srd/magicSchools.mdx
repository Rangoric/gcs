<p class="initial">Almost every spell belongs to one of eight
schools of magic. A school of magic is a group of related spells that
work in similar ways. A small number of spells (<a
href="spellsAtoB.html#arcane-mark" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">arcane
mark</a>, <a href="spellsHtoL.html#limited-wish"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">limited wish</a>, <a
href="spellsPtoR.html#permanency" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">permanency</a>,
<a href="spellsPtoR.html#prestidigitation"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">prestidigitation</a>, and <a
href="spellsTtoZ.html#wish" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">wish</a>)
are universal, belonging to no school.</p>
<a id="abjuration"></a><h6>Abjuration</h6>
<p class="initial">Abjurations are protective spells. They create
physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical abilities,
harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another
plane of existence. </p>
<p>If one abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of another
for 24 hours or more, the magical fields interfere with each other and
create barely visible energy fluctuations. The DC to find such spells
with the <a href="skillsAll.html#search"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a> skill drops by 4.</p>
<p>If an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of
creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used to push away those
creatures. If you force the barrier against such a creature, you feel a
discernible pressure against the barrier. If you continue to apply
pressure, you end the spell.</p>
<a id="conjuration"></a><h6>Conjuration</h6>
<p class="initial">Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five
subschools. Conjurations bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or
some form of energy to you (the summoning subschool), actually
transport creatures from another plane of existence to your plane
(calling), heal (healing), transport creatures or objects over great
distances (teleportation), or create objects or effects on the spot
(creation). Creatures you conjure usually, but not always, obey your
commands.</p>
<p>A creature or object brought into being or transported to your
location by a conjuration spell cannot appear inside another creature
or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive
in an open location on a surface capable of supporting it. The creature
or object must appear within the spell&#8217;s range, but it does not have to
remain within the range.</p>
<a id="calling"></a><p><b>Calling</b>: A calling spell transports a creature from
another plane to the plane you are on. The spell grants the creature
the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the
spell may limit the circumstances under which this is possible.
Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do not
disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see
below). The duration of a calling spell is instantaneous, which means
that the called creature can&#8217;t be dispelled.</p>
<a id="creation"></a><p><b>Creation</b>: A creation spell manipulates matter to create
an object or creature in the place the spellcaster designates (subject
to the limits noted above). If the spell has a duration other than
instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and when the spell
ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the
spell has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is
merely assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not
depend on magic for its existence.</p>
<a id="healing"></a><p><b>Healing</b>: Certain divine conjurations heal creatures or
even bring them back to life.</p>
<a id="summoning"></a><p><b>Summoning</b>: A summoning spell instantly brings a
creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell ends or is
dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came
from, but a summoned object is not sent back unless the spell
description specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes
away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0 or lower. It is not
really <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dead</a>. It takes 24 hours for the
creature to reform, during which
time it can&#8217;t be summoned again.</p>
<p>When the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature
disappears, all the spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature
cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have, and it refuses
to cast any spells that would cost it XP, or to use any spell-like
abilities that would cost XP if they were spells.</p>
<a id="teleportation"></a><p><b>Teleportation</b>: A teleportation spell transports one or
more creatures or objects a great distance. The most powerful of these
spells can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning spells, the
transportation is (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.
Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane.
Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.</p>
<a id="divination"></a><h6>Divination</h6>
<p class="initial">Divination spells enable you to learn secrets
long forgotten, to predict the future, to find hidden things, and to
foil deceptive spells.</p>
<p>Many divination spells have cone-shaped areas. These move with
you and extend in the direction you look. The cone defines the area
that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple
rounds, you can often gain additional information, as noted in the
descriptive text for the spell.</p>
<a id="scrying"></a><p><b>Scrying</b>: A scrying spell creates an <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a> magical
sensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor
has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This level of
acuity includes any spells or effects that target you, but not spells
or effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is treated as a
separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions
normally even if you have been <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">blinded</a>, <a
href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#deafened"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">deafened</a>, or otherwise suffered
sensory impairment. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or
higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence check. The
sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell.</p>
<p>Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks a scrying spell,
and you sense that the spell is so blocked.</p>
<a id="enchantment"></a><h6>Enchantment</h6>
<p class="initial">Enchantment spells affect the minds of others,
influencing or controlling their behavior.</p>
<p>All enchantments are mind-affecting spells. Two types of
enchantment spells grant you influence over a subject creature.</p>
<a id="charm"></a><p><b>Charm</b>: A charm spell changes how the subject views you,
typically making it see you as a good friend.</p>
<a id="compulsion"></a><p><b>Compulsion</b>: A compulsion spell forces the subject to
act in some manner or changes the way her mind works. Some compulsion
spells determine the subject&#8217;s actions or the effects on the subject,
some compulsion spells allow you to determine the subject&#8217;s actions
when you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control over the
subject.</p>
<a id="evocation"></a><h6>Evocation</h6>
<p class="initial">Evocation spells manipulate energy or tap an
unseen source of power to produce a desired end. In effect, they create
something out of nothing. Many of these spells produce spectacular
effects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of damage.</p>
<a id="illusion"></a><h6>Illusion</h6>
<p class="initial">Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of
others. They cause people to see things that are not there, not see
things that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that
never happened.</p>
<a id="figment"></a><p><b>Figment</b>: A figment spell creates a false sensation.
Those who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not their own
slightly different versions of the figment. (It is not a personalized
mental impression.) Figments cannot make something seem to be something
else. A figment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate
intelligible speech unless the spell description specifically says it
can. If intelligible speech is possible, it must be in a language you
can speak. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot speak, the
image produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of
something unless you know what it looks like.</p>
<p>Because figments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they
cannot produce real effects the way that other types of illusions can.
They cannot cause damage to objects or creatures, support weight,
provide nutrition, or provide protection from the elements.
Consequently, these spells are useful for confounding or delaying foes,
but useless for attacking them directly. </p>
<p>A figment&#8217;s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.</p>
<a id="glamer"></a><p><b>Glamer</b>: A glamer spell changes a subject&#8217;s sensory
qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something
else, or even seem to disappear.</p>
<a id="pattern"></a><p><b>Pattern</b>: Like a figment, a pattern spell creates an
image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the minds of
those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting
spells.</p>
<a id="phantasm"></a><p><b>Phantasm</b>: A phantasm spell creates a mental image that
usually only the caster and the subject (or subjects) of the spell can
perceive. This impression is totally in the minds of the subjects. It
is a personalized mental impression. (It&#8217;s all in their heads and not a
fake picture or something that they actually see.) Third parties
viewing or studying the scene don&#8217;t notice the phantasm. All phantasms
are mind-affecting spells.</p>
<a id="shadow"></a><p><b>Shadow</b>: A shadow spell creates something that is
partially real from extradimensional energy. Such illusions can have
real effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion is real.</p>
<a id="saving-throws-and-illusions-disbelief"></a><p><b>Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief)</b>: Creatures
encountering an illusion usually do not receive saving throws to
recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with
it in some fashion.</p>
<p>A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be
false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.</p>
<p>A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to
notice something is amiss. A character faced with proof that an
illusion isn&#8217;t real needs no saving throw. If any viewer successfully
disbelieves an illusion and communicates this fact to others, each such
viewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.</p>
<a id="necromancy"></a><h6>Necromancy</h6>
<p class="initial">Necromancy spells manipulate the power of
death, unlife, and the life force. Spells involving undead creatures
make up a large part of this school. </p>
<a id="transmutation"></a><h6>Transmutation</h6>
<p class="initial">Transmutation spells change the properties of
some creature, thing, or condition. </p>
