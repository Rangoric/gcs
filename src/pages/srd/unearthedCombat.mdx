Action points give character the means to affect game play in significant
ways, by improving important rolls or unlocking special abilities. Each
character has a limited number of action points, and once an action point
is spent, it is gone for good.
<h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-action-points"></a>
BEHIND THE CURTAIN: ACTION POINTS
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">Action points give players some control over poor die rolls. Although this
has little effect in an average encounter, it makes it a little more
likely that characters will survive extremely challenging encounters and
less likely that a single character will fall to what would otherwise be a
balanced foe because of bad luck. A reserve of action points lets even
careful players expose their characters to more risks, heightening the
game�s tension and opening the door to even more heroic action. This
variant also makes it less likely that an entire adventuring group will
fall victim to one powerful effect, such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#circle-of-death">circle of death</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#cloudkill">cloudkill</a>.
<p>
Action points also make it more likely that the use of a character�s most
potent abilities will be successful. For example, although its overall
effect on an encounter might be minimal, few things frustrate a paladin
more than missing with a smite attack � an event that becomes less likely
when using action points.
</p>
<p>
That said, action points can also lead characters to routinely get in over
their heads (relying on action points to save themselves), and for GMs to
unconsciously increase the difficulty of encounters (since characters are
more likely to succeed against foes of equal power). This is as fine as
long as the characters have a reserve of such points to spend � but if they
run out, encounters that would otherwise be merely challenging can become
incredibly deadly. Keep the number of action points available to your
characters in mind when designing encounters.
</p>
<p>
For GMs who are worried that action points increase the power level of
characters without an offsetting cost, there�s an easy solution. Just
think of each action point as a one-use magic item with a broad range of
possible effects. With that analogy, it becomes easy to justify reducing
the amount of treasure awarded to balance out the accrual of action
points. Note that this is merely a tool for GMs interested in carefully
monitoring character power levels; action points should never be for sale.
</p>
<p>
An action point is roughly equivalent to a magic item worth 100 gp per
character level (since the higher a character�s level, the more potent the
effect).
</p></div>
<h5><a id="aquairing-action-points"></a>
ACQUIRING ACTION POINTS
</h5>
A beginning (1st-level) character starts the game with 5 action points. A
character above 1st level starts the game with a number of action points
equal to 5 + 1/2 his current character level.
<p>
Every time a character advances, he gains a number of action points equal
to 5 + 1/2 his new character level. Some prestige classes might allow a
faster rate of accrual, at the GM�s option.
</p>
<h6><a id="action-points-and-existing-games"></a>
Action Points and Existing Games
</h6>
Adding action points to an existing campaign is easy, since characters
don�t need to make any special changes. Each character simply gains a
number of action points equal to 5 + 1/2 his character level.
<h6><a id="npcs-and-action-points"></a>
NPCs and Action Points
</h6>
Most NPCs probably shouldn�t have action points, due to the added
complexity this would create. In the case of important villains or other
significant characters, however, the GM may award them an appropriate
number of action points to use against the player characters. A number of
action points equal to 1/2 the NPC�s level is a good baseline.
<h5><a id="using-action-points"></a>
USING ACTION POINTS
</h5>
You can spend 1 action point either to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#add-to-a-roll">add to a single d20 roll</a>, to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#special-actions">take a
special action</a>, or to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#improve-feats">improve the use of a feat</a>.
<p>
You can spend 1 action point in a round. If you spend a point to use a
special action (see below), you can�t spend another one in the same round
to improve a die roll, and vice versa.
</p>
<h6><a id="add-to-a-roll"></a>
Add to a Roll
</h6>
When you spend 1 action point to improve a d20 roll, you add the result of
a 1d6 to your d20 roll (including attack rolls, saves,
checks, or any other roll of a d20) to help you meet or exceed the target
number. You can declare the use of 1 action point to alter a d20 roll
after the roll is made, but only before the GM reveals the result of that
roll. You can�t use an action point to alter the result of a d20 roll when
you are taking 10 or taking 20.
<p>
Depending on character level (see table), a character might be able to
roll more than one d6 when he spends 1 action point. If so, apply the
highest result and disregard the other rolls. A 15th-level character, for
instance, gets to roll 3d6 and take the best result of the three. So, if
he rolled a 1, 2, and 4, he would apply the 4 to his d20 roll.

Special Actions
</h6>
A character can perform certain tasks by spending an action point. In
addition to the actions described below, some prestige classes or feats
(see below) might allow the expenditure of action points in order to gain
or activate specific abilities, at the GM�s option.
<p><b><a id="activate-class-ability"></a>Activate Class Ability:</b>
A character can spend 1 action point to gain another use of a class
ability that has a limited number of uses per day. For example, a monk
might spend an action point to gain another use of her stunning fist
ability, or a paladin might spend an action point to make an additional
smite attack.
</p>
<p><b><a id="boost-defence"></a>Boost Defense:</b>
A character can spend 1 action point as a free action when
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="actionsInCombat.html#fighting-defensively">fighting defensively</a>. This gives him double the normal benefits for
fighting defensively for the entire round (+4 dodge bonus to AC; +6 if he has 5 or
more ranks in Tumble).
</p>
<p><b><a id="emulate-feat"></a>Emulate Feat:</b>
At the beginning of a character�s turn, he may spend 1 action point as a
free action to gain the benefit of a feat he doesn�t have. He must meet the prerequisites
of the feat. He gains the benefit until the beginning of his next turn.
</p>
<p><b><a id="extra-attack"></a>Extra attack:</b>
During any round in which a character takes a full attack action, he may
spend 1 action point to make an extra attack at his highest base attack
bonus. Action points may be used in this way with both melee and ranged
attacks.
</p>
<p><b><a id="spell-boost"></a>Spell Boost:</b>
A character can spend 1 action point as a free action to increase
the effective caster level of one of his spells by 2. He must decide
whether or not to spend an action point in this manner before casting the
spell.
</p>
<p><b><a id="spell-recall"></a>Spell Recall:</b>
Spellcasters who prepare their spells in advance can spend 1 action point
to recall any spell just cast. The spell can be cast again later with no
effect on other prepared spells. This use of an action point is a free action and can only
be done in the same round that the spell is cast. Spontaneous spellcasters
such as sorcerers and bards can spend 1 action point to cast a spell
without using one of their daily spell slots. This use of an action point
is a free action and can only be done as the spell is being cast.
</p>
<p><b><a id="stable"></a>Stable:</b>
Any time a character is dying, he can spend 1 action point to become
stable at his current hit point total.
</p>
<h6><a id="improving-feats"></a>
Improving Feats
</h6>
The use of action points opens up a whole range of possible feats.
However, it�s easier on characters simply to improve existing feats to
take advantage of action points � that way, characters needn�t spend their
precious feat slots simply to gain the ability to use their action points.
Below are a few examples of how action points can be used with existing
feats. Unless otherwise stated, each effect requires a free action to activate
and lasts 1 round.
<p><b><a id="blind-fight"></a>Blind-Fight:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to negate your miss chance for a single
attack.
</p>
<p><b><a id="combat-expertise"></a>Combat Expertise:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to double the bonus to Armor Class granted by
the feat. For example, if you take a penalty of -3 on your attack roll, you gain a
+6 dodge bonus to AC.
</p>
<p><b><a id="dodge"></a>Dodge:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to increase the dodge bonus granted by the feat to +2.
The effect lasts for the entire encounter.
</p>
<p><b><a id="improved-critical"></a>Improved Critical:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to double your critical threat range. Since
two doublings equals a tripling, this benefit increases your threat range
from 19-20 to 18-20, from 17-20 to 15-20, or from 15-20 to 12-20,
including the effect of your Improved Critical feat. This benefit stacks
with the benefit from Improved Critical, but not with other effects that
increase threat range.
</p>
<p><b><a id="improved-initiative"></a>Improved Initiative:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to double the bonus on initiative checks
granted by the feat, from +4 to +8.
</p>
<p><b><a id="metamagic-feats"></a>Metamagic Feats:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to add the effect of any one metamagic feat
that you have to a spell you are casting. The spell is cast at its normal
level (without any level adjustment because of the feat) and takes no
extra time to cast.
</p>
<p>
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#heighten-spell">Heighten Spell</a> automatically raises a spell�s effective level to the
highest level of spell you are capable of casting. For example, if a
7th-level wizard with the Heighten Spell feat casts burning hands and
spends 1 action point to heighten the spell, the spell is treated as if it
were a 4th-level spell in all respects even though the wizard prepared it
normally (as a 1st-level spell).
</p>
<p><b><a id="power-attack"></a>Power Attack:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to double the bonus on damage rolls granted
by the feat. For example, if you take a penalty of -3 on your attack roll, you add +6
to your damage roll.
</p>
<p><b><a id="spell-focus"></a>Spell Focus:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to double the increase to save DCs granted by
the feat, from +1 to +2.
</p>
<p><b><a id="spell-penetration"></a>Spell Penetration:</b>
You can spend 1 action point to double the bonus on caster level
checks granted by the feat, from +2 to +4. The effect lasts for the
entire encounter.
