<p>Despite
the near-magical nature of some epic level skill uses,
all uses of skills are considered exceptional abilities (except if
noted otherwise), and thus function normally even within areas of
antimagic. </p>
<a id="epic-skill-synergy"></a><h6>Skill Synergy </h6>
<p>Many skills are noted as
granting a synergy bonus to the use
of another skill when a character has 5 or more ranks in the first
skill. This synergy bonus increases by +2 for every additional 20 ranks
the character has in the skill. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instill Suggestion in
Target:</span>
This is identical to the effect of the suggestion spell, except that it
is nonmagical and lasts for only 10 minutes. It can be sensed as if it
were an enchantment effect (Sense Motive DC 25). </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display False Alignment:</span>
The character can fool alignment-sensing effects by displaying a false
alignment of his or her choice. Once set, a false alignment remains as
long as the character remains conscious and awake. Setting or changing
a false alignment requires a full-round action. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disguise Surface Thoughts:</span>
The character can fool spells such as detect thoughts (or similar
effects) by displaying false surface thoughts. While the character
can&rsquo;t completely mask the presence of his or her thoughts, he
or she
can change his or her apparent Intelligence score (and thus the
character&rsquo;s apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points
and can
place any thought in his or her &ldquo;surface thoughts&rdquo;
to be read by such
spells or effects. If a character attempts to use Sense Motive to
detect his or her surface thoughts (see the Sense Motive skill
description), this becomes an opposed check (though any result lower
than 100 automatically fails). </p>

checks), but the character takes a -20 penalty on his or her check. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special:</span>
The Legendary

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Creation:</span>
A
character can voluntarily increase the DC of crafting an item by any
multiple of 10. This allows the character to create an item more
quickly (since he or she will be multiplying this higher DC by his or
her skill check result to determine progress). The character must
decide the increase to the DC before making the check. </p>

</table>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create Augmented
Alchemical
Item or Substance:</span> This
requires the Augmented Alchemy feat, and
allows a character to create alchemical items and substances of greater
power than normal. To augment an alchemical substance, add +20 to the
DC required to create the item and multiply the cost by 5. If the item
or substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or
substance doesn&rsquo;t deal damage, double the duration of its
effect. If
the item or substance doesn&rsquo;t deal damage and
doesn&rsquo;t have a specific
listed duration (or has an instantaneous duration), double all
dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn&rsquo;t fit
any of
these categories, then it cannot be improved in this manner. A
character can create an item with multiple degrees of augmentation. For
every additional multiplier applied to damage, duration, or area, add
an additional +20 to the DC and add an additional 5 to the cost
multiplier.

The attitude
of fanatic is added here. In addition to the obvious effects, any NPC
whose attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and
Constitution scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -1 penalty
to AC whenever fighting for the character or his or her cause. This
attitude will remain for one day plus one day per point of the
character&rsquo;s Charisma bonus, at which point the
NPC&rsquo;s attitude will
revert to its original attitude (or indifferent, if no attitude is
specified). </p>
<p>Treat the fanatic
attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment
effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or being detected by the
Sense Motive skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can&rsquo;t be
dispelled;
however, any effect that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects
will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC&rsquo;s attitude
can&rsquo;t be further
adjusted by the use of skills.

<p>Treat the fanatic
attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment
effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or being detected by the
Sense Motive skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can&rsquo;t be

will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC&rsquo;s attitude

This use of the skill lets a character discern one component of a

states whether
he or she is trying to discern the law-chaos or good-evil component. A
character can&rsquo;t retry the check, and he or she
can&rsquo;t use this to
discern more than one component of the alignment (but see below). The
target must be visible and within 30 feet of the character. </p>

target&rsquo;s alignment. The character can&rsquo;t retry the
check. The target
must be visible and within 30 feet of the character. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Detect Surface Thoughts:</span>
This lets a character read the surface thoughts of a single target (as
the 3rd-round effect of the detect thoughts spell). There is no saving
throw to resist this effect, though the target can use Bluff to
disguise his or her surface thoughts (see the Bluff skill description),
in which case this becomes an opposed check (any result lower than 100
automatically fails). The target must be visible and within 30 feet of
