Because magic plays such an important role in the game, the
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="wizard.html">wizard</a> class offers great opportunities for change when
designing a campaign or a character. The following variants
present different versions of the standard specialist
wizards. Each variant specialist class gives up one of the
standard specialists class abilities in exchange for a new
ability unique to the variant specialist. Each specialist
class has three variants: one that replaces the specialist's
summon familiar ability, one that replaces the specialist's
bonus feats, and one that replaces the specialist's bonus
spell per day from the specialty school.
<p>
Because each variant requires the loss of an existing
ability, you can use more than one of these variants at the
same time. By choosing among the variant abilities presented
for each specialist, you can easily customize the way that
magic works in a campaign, in a geographic region of a
campaign, for a school of magic, or even for a single
spellcaster. Players can easily create unique and interesting
characters using these variants.
</p>
<p>
For example, a campaign might be set up with some or all of
the following variants for specialist wizards.
</p>
<ul>
<li>All abjurers in the campaign have the resistance to
energy variant ability because the setting includes a large
number of gates to the elemental planes.
</li>

<li>Evokers from a specific city all have the overcome
resistance ability, but they do not gain additional spells as
specialist wizards. However, other evokers in the campaign
gain abilities exactly as standard evokers and consider the
evokers of that city a disruptive offshoot of the pure study
of magic.
</li>

<li>The students and masters at a college of necromancy from
a distant region slowly undergo undead apotheosis instead of
gaining bonus feats, but most necromancers in the campaign
gain abilities exactly as standard necromancers. This
difference has led some to feel that the foreign necromancers
have a more thorough understanding of the powers of death.
Traditional necromancers have a hard time attracting
students, while the foreigners gain several new apprentices
each year.
</li>

<li>One conjurer of particular power in the city cannot
obtain a familiar and instead casts summoning spells
exceptionally quickly, as described in the rapid summoning
variant ability. He claims he can teach others to wield magic
as he does, but so far he has gathered few students.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to a description of the variant class's
abilities, each entry below includes brief suggestions on
sample campaigns, adventures, or characters that might
benefit from the use of the variant specialists. These notes
are suggestions only, since nearly any campaign can benefit
from adding variety to spells and spellcasters.
</p>
<p>
Although these abilities allow the creation and customization
of variant classes, a character cannot, for example, take a
few levels of conjurer using the rapid summoning variant and
then "multiclass" into regular conjurer levels. These
variants all follow the normal rules for multiclassing by
specialist wizards.
</p>
<h5><a id="abjurer"></a>
ABJURER VARIANTS
</h5>
Masters of protective magic, abjurers can fill many roles in
a campaign, from bodyguard to battlemage to adventurer.
Although it lacks offensive options, the school of abjuration
provides some of the most effective combat spells in the
game. An evoker or transmuter might find it easier to bring
down large groups of foes, but an abjurer is far more likely
to bring herself and her companions through a fight alive.
<p>
In a campaign with a high degree of intrigue or political
machinations, the protective abilities of an abjurer can
guard against foes both obvious and unexpected, and rival
groups of abjurers, all with slightly different powers, might
vie for prominence among each nation's schemers and
courtiers. In combat-heavy campaigns, realms might employ
abjuration specialists to protect against the battle magic of
their rivals, and in any campaign, adventurers might come to
rely on the skills of an abjurer to protect against the
dangers of dungeon and wilderness.
</p>
<h6><a id="resistance-to-energy"></a>
Resistance to Energy (Su)
</h6>
Once per day, an abjurer using this variant can create a
mystical shield that grants herself or any one creature that
she touches limited protection against a chosen energy type
(acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The affected
creature gains <a style="color: #579EB6" href="monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy">resistance</a> equal to 5 plus one-half the
abjurer's class level against the chosen energy type.
Activating this ability is a standard action. Once activated,
the protection lasts for 1 hour. This protection overlaps
with (and does not stack with) the effects of spells such as
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsPtoR.html#resist-energy">resist energy</a>.
<p>
An abjurer using this variant permanently gives up the
ability to obtain a familiar.
</p>
<h6><a id="aura-of-protection"></a>
Aura of Protection (Ex)
</h6>
Once per day, a 5th-level abjurer using this variant can
generate a protective aura that shields against both physical
and magical attacks. When the abjurer generates this field,
she gains a deflection bonus to her Armor Class and a
resistance bonus on all saving throws equal to her
Intelligence modifier. This ability requires a standard
action to activate, and each use protects against only one
attack or spell. Once activated, the protective aura lasts
for 1 minute or until the abjurer is attacked or required to
make a saving throw, whichever comes first.
<p>
An abjurer using this variant can use this ability one
additional time per day for every five class levels gained
above 5th.
</p>
<p>
An abjurer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for
advancing as a wizard.
</p>
<h6><a id="spontaneous-dispelling"></a>
Spontaneous Dispelling (Ex)
</h6>
At 5th level, an abjurer using this variant gains the ability
to spontaneously cast the spell <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsDtoE.html#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>. This ability is
similar to the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast cure
spells, with a few exceptions. The abjurer can "lose" four or
more levels of prepared spells to cast dispel magic. The
prepared spells can be of any level or combination of levels
as long as the total spell levels add up to four or more
(0-level spells don't count). For example, an abjurer using
this variant could lose two 2nd-level spells or one 1st-level
spell and one 3rd-level spell to cast dispel magic.
<p>
At 11th level, an abjurer can "lose" seven or more levels of
prepared spells to spontaneously cast <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsDtoE.html#greater-dispel-magic">greater dispel magic</a>.
</p>
<p>
An abjurer using this variant can use it in conjunction with
a readied action to use dispel magic or greater dispel magic
as a counterspell.
</p>
<p>
An abjurer using this variant does not gain additional spells
per day for being a specialist wizard.
</p>
<h5><a id="conjurer"></a>
CONJURER VARIANTS
</h5>
One of the most versatile schools of magic, conjuration
offers its disciples an effective solution to nearly any
task: simply summon the appropriate monster and let it solve
the problem. In combat, high-level conjurers fight from
behind wave after wave of summoned foes, and in most battles
they simply direct their summoned allies into the conflict.
In addition to these vaunted summoning powers, conjuration
provides effective combat spells and access to teleportation
magic.
<p>
While virtually any campaign can benefit from rival groups of
conjurers serving diverse agendas, conjurers are particularly
effective in combat-heavy campaigns. Campaigns that feature a
great deal of long-distance travel or travel between planes
also benefit from including diverse groups of conjurers,
because their specialty facilitates travel and encourages a
thorough understanding of the creatures of the Outer Planes.
</p>
<h6><a id="rapid-summoning"></a>
Rapid Summoning (Ex)
</h6>
Any time a conjurer using this variant casts a <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsS.html#summon-monster-i">summon monster</a>
spell, its casting time is 1 standard action rather than 1
full round. (Creatures so summoned can only take a standard
action in the round they are summoned.) Conjurers using this
variant gain the normal benefits from enhancing a summon
monster spell with the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a> feat.
<p>
A conjurer using this variant permanently gives up the
ability to obtain a familiar.
</p>
<h6><a id="enhanced-summoning"></a>
Enhanced Summoning (Ex)
</h6>
At 1st level, a conjurer using this variant gains the
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#augment-summoning">Augment Summoning</a> feat for free instead of the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#scribe-scroll">Scribe
Scroll</a> feat.
<p>
At 5th level, the conjurer's summoned creatures become
particularly tough to <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsDtoE.html#dispel-magic">dispel</a>. Add 2 to the DC of any caster
level check made to dispel the conjurer's summoned creatures.
At 15th level, this addition to the DC increases to 4.
</p>
<p>
At 10th level, the conjurer's summoned creatures gain an
additional +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution. At 20th
level, these bonuses increase to +4. These bonuses stack with
those granted by the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#augment-summoning">Augment Summoning</a> feat.
</p>
<p>
A conjurer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for
advancing as a wizard.
</p>
<h6><a id="spontaneous-summoning"></a>
Spontaneous Summoning (Ex)
</h6>
Conjurers using this variant can "lose" a prepared spell to
cast any <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsS.html#summon-monster-i">summon monster</a> spell of a lower level. For example,
a conjurer who has prepared <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsHtoL.html#greater-invisibility">greater invisibility</a> (a 4th-level
spell) may lose that spell to cast <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsS.html#summon-monster-i">summon monster I</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsS.html#summon-monster-ii">summon
monster II</a>, or <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsS.html#summon-monster-iii">summon monster III</a>.
<p>
A conjurer using this variant does not gain additional spells
per day for being a specialist wizard.
</p>
<p>
<i>Note:</i> Since conjurers using this variant obviously
summon monsters frequently, the game master should require
the conjurer's player to prepare simple record sheets ahead
of time for each monster that the character commonly summons.
It is also important to emphasize speedy play on the part of
the conjurer and his summoned monsters.
</p>
<h5><a id="diviner"></a>
DIVINER VARIANTS
</h5>
Seekers of knowledge, hoarders of lore, and master spies,
diviners are perhaps the most underrated specialist wizards.
Because they must give up access to only one other school of
magic, they are also the most versatile specialists. More
than any other specialists, diviners excel at gathering
information, and an adventuring party that includes a diviner
is much more likely to prepare properly for an adventure.
<p>
Many campaigns benefit from featuring more than one type of
divination specialist, and diviners can play important parts
in any game revolving around information gathering. Campaigns
that feature mysteries and detective-style adventures, themes
of prophecy and oracles, or large amounts of social
interaction and espionage all make excellent forums for a
diviner's powers. In campaigns that feature variant diviners
with different class abilities, one simple way to add more
variety is to make each distinct group of specialists experts
in and proponents of a different form of divination. In game
terms, this divergence is represented by altering the
material components for some divination spells. For example,
one group of diviners might favor osteomancy and require a
collection of bones to use as components for their spells.
</p>
<h6><a id="enhanced-awareness"></a>
Enhanced Awareness (Ex)
</h6>
A diviner using this variant adds <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> to her list of
class skills. In addition, she gains minor benefits when
casting certain divination spells.
<p>
She needs only to study an item for 10 minutes (rather than 1
hour) when casting <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsHtoL.html#identify">identify</a>.
</p>
<p>
An <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsAtoB.html#arcane-eye">arcane eye</a> cast by the diviner travels at 20 feet per
round when studying its surroundings (rather than 10 feet per
round).
</p>
<p>
Add +1 to the saving throw DCs of the character's divination
spells. (This bonus stacks with the bonus from the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#spell-focus">Spell
Focus</a> and <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#greater-spell-focus">Greater Spell Focus</a> feats.)
</p>
<p>
A diviner using this variant permanently gives up the ability
to obtain a familiar.
</p>
<h6><a id="bonus-feat-list"></a>
Bonus Feat List
</h6>
A diviner using this variant gradually grows in awareness and
perceptive ability, but at the expense of her metamagic
capabilities. The diviner may not select a <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsMtm.html">metamagic feat</a> as
a wizard bonus feat (that is, those feats gained at 5th,
10th, 15th, and 20th level). However, the following feats are
added to the list of bonus feats available to her at those
levels: <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#alertness">Alertness</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#blind-fight">Blind-Fight</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#improved-initiative">Improved Initiative</a>,
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#lightning-reflexes">Lightning Reflexes</a>, and <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#skill-focus">Skill Focus</a> (<a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#spot">Spot</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#listen">Listen</a>, or <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#sense-motive">Sense
Motive</a> only).
<h6><a id="prescience"></a>
Prescience (Ex)
</h6>
Gifted with extraordinary insight and perceptive abilities, a
diviner using this variant can add an insight bonus equal to
her Intelligence modifier to any attack roll, saving throw,
skill check, or level check she makes. The diviner can use
this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
for every five class levels attained. Using this ability is a
free action that can be taken out of turn if needed, but the
character must choose to use this ability before the die roll
is made.
<p>
A diviner using this variant does not gain additional spells
per day for being a specialist wizard.
</p>
<h5><a id="enchanter">
ENHANTER VARIANTS
</a></h5>
Charmer, schemer, deceiver, pacifist: an enchanter can be all
these and more. As a practitioner of one of the most subtle
schools of magic, an enchanter might charm a guard into
opening a well-defended gate that fifty warriors couldn't
take by force. Good-aligned enchanters use their powers to
seek out truth and encourage others onto the path of good,
while their evil counterparts bend others' minds at their
whim and gather personal power as rapidly as possible.
<p>
Campaigns that feature a large amount of social scenarios,
political intrigue, or investigation benefit greatly from the
inclusion of variant enchanters. These spellcasters, skilled
in the manipulation of others and capable of concealing their
own identities, make excellent villains and manipulators, or
even investigators skilled at using magic to draw the truth
out of opponents.
</p>
<p>
Players and game masters alike should also consider the
ramifications that enchantment spells and similar effects
have on a game world. Is casting <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsC.html#charm-person">charm person</a> legal? Is a
character legally responsible for actions taken while
charmed? Do most of the campaign's inhabitants know that
enchantment effects exist? Are there folk remedies that
supposedly provide protection against enchantment effects? Do
they actually work? Having ready answers to these and similar
questions not only adds consistency to the game, but also
clarifies and highlights the role of the enchanter.
</p>
<h6><a id="cohort"></a>
Cohort
</h6>
Upon reaching 6th level, an enchanter using this variant
gains the service of a loyal cohort of the player's choice
(with the game master's approval). The cohort is a 4th-level
character when first gained; after that point, follow the
normal rules described in the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#leadership">Leadership</a> feat to determine
the cohort's level, but treat the enchanter's level as being
two lower than normal.
<p>
The enchanter doesn't gain any followers from this ability.
If the enchanter selects the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#leadership">Leadership</a> feat, he attracts
followers as normal, the penalty to the enchanter's effective
level is eliminated, and the enchanter automatically
qualifies for the "special power" modifier to his Leadership
score.
</p>
<p>
An enchanter using this variant permanently gives up the
ability to obtain a familiar.
</p>
<h6><a id="social-proficiency"></a>
Social Proficiency (Ex)
</h6>
Enchanters using this variant are as proficient at
manipulating others through mundane means as they are at
influencing their minds magically. Add the following skills
to the character's list of wizard class skills: <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a>,
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#gather-information">Gather Information</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#intimidate">Intimidate</a>, and <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>.
The enchanter also gains a +2 competence bonus on checks
involving one of these skills (player's choice) every five
levels (5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th). This bonus can only be
applied once to each skill.
<p>
An enchanter using this variant does not gain bonus feats for
advancing as a wizard.
</p>
<h6><a id="extended-enchantment"></a>
Extended Enchantment (Su)
</h6>
Enchanters using this variant ensnare the minds of others
more easily with their magic, and as a result their
enchantment spells last longer than those cast by other
spellcasters. Once per day, plus one additional time per two
class levels gained above 1st, an enchanter using this
variant can cast a spell from the enchantment school as if it
were enhanced by the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#extend-spell">Extend Spell</a> metamagic feat. This
enhancement does not affect the spell's level.
<p>
This ability cannot be used to extend a spell with a duration
of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent.
</p>
<p>
An enchanter using this variant does not gain additional
spells per day for being a specialist wizard.
</p>
<h5><a id="evoker"></a>
EVOKER VARIANTS
</h5>
Masters of the raw power of magical energy, evokers can turn
the tide of a battle with a single powerful spell, leveling
groups of foes faster than any other practitioner of magic.
Where some wizards focus on careful spell preparation and
protective spells to survive combat encounters, evokers
simply blast away with powerful energy attacks. Their
prodigious offensive abilities ensure that evokers become the
center of an adventuring group's battle plan.
<p>
Campaigns that include large numbers of wizards aligned to
different nations are particularly suitable for variant
evokers, since each nation develops unique cadres of evokers
to serve in battle. Groups of militant evokers marching in
unison with more conventional groups can change the tide of
nearly any battle. In addition, campaigns that include themes
of primal energy, raw nature, or extreme elemental conditions
can all benefit from introducing evokers with variant
abilities. Evokers in these sorts of campaigns might explore
the raw essence of magic, struggling to harness its energies
in new and unique ways.
</p>
<h6><a id="energy-affinity"></a>
Energy Affinity (Ex)
</h6>
Evokers using this variant must choose an energy type (acid,
cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This choice is made upon
character creation and cannot be altered thereafter. Any time
the character casts an evocation spell with the chosen energy
type, she casts the spell as if her caster level were one
higher (affecting range, duration, damage, caster level
checks, and any other factor influenced by caster level).
<p>
An evoker using this variant permanently gives up the ability
to obtain a familiar.
</p>
<h6><a id="energy-substitution"></a>
Energy Substitution (Ex)
</h6>
An evoker of 5th level or higher using this variant can
substitute energy of one type for another. When casting a
spell that has an energy descriptor (acid, cold, electricity,
fire, or sonic), the evoker can change the energy descriptor
and the spell's effects to energy of a different type.
<p>
Using this ability is a free action that must be declared
before the spell is cast. The evoker can use this ability
once per day for each five class levels he has attained
(1/day at 5th, 2/day at 10th, and so on).
</p>
<p>
An evoker using this variant does not gain bonus feats for
advancing as a wizard.
</p>
<h6><a id="overcome-resistance"></a>
Overcome Resistance (Ex)
</h6>
The energy spells of an evoker using this variant can ignore
some or all of a target's <a style="color: #579EB6" href="monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy">resistance to energy</a>. Using this
ability is a free action that must be announced before the
evoker casts the spell to be affected. Every creature
affected by the spell is treated as if its resistance to the
spell's energy type was 10 points lower, to a minimum of 0.
(This lowered resistance applies only to this spell; other
effects with the same energy descriptor must get through the
creature's normal resistance.)
<p>
The overcome resistance ability does not give the affected
spell any ability to affect creatures with immunity to the
spell's energy type, nor does the affected spell have any
additional effect on creatures that do not have resistance to
energy.
</p>
<p>
An evoker may use this ability one time per day, plus one
additional time per day for every two class levels attained
beyond 1st (2/day at 3rd, 3/day at 5th, and so forth).
</p>
<p>
An evoker using this variant does not gain additional spells
per day for being a specialist wizard.
</p>
<h5><a id="illusionist"></a>
ILLUSIONIST VARIANTS
</h5>
<a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/UnA_Gallery/79158.jpg"><img
class="art-wide" src="pict.jpg" title="" alt="pict"
style="border: 0px solid ; width: 73px; height: 75px;" /></a>
Illusionists control their surroundings by shaping,
distorting, and deceiving the perceptions of others. To some
their abilities seem weak, because they only distort and
disguise rather than effecting true change, but those
affected by an illusionist's spells know better,
understanding that their own senses can be turned against
them at any time.
<p>
Campaigns that deal in deception or that have a high level of
social interaction, a fair number of mystery adventures, or
even simply suspicious players can benefit from the
introduction of variant illusionists. Campaigns featuring
multiple types of variant illusionists might give each group
or variant an even more distinctive flavor by making each the
master of a particular subset of illusion spells.
Illusionists from one nation might, for example, have the
chains of disbelief variant ability and favor phantasms,
while the illusionist thieves of the Guild of Shadows might
have the shadow shaper variant ability and favor glamers and
shadow magic.
</p>
<h6><a id="chains-of-disbelief"></a>
Chains of Disbelief (Ex)
</h6>
Even if a viewer disbelieves an illusion created by an
illusionist using this variant and communicates the details
of the illusion to other creatures, those other creatures do
not receive the normal +4 bonus on their saying throws to
disbelieve the illusion. Furthermore, even when presented
with incontrovertible proof that the illusion isn't real,
creatures must still succeed on a Will saving throw to see
objects or creatures that the illusion obscures, although
they get a +10 bonus on the saving throw.
<p>
An illusionist using this variant permanently gives up the
ability to obtain a familiar.
</p>
<h6><a id="shadow-shaper"></a>
Shadow Shaper
</h6>
An illusionist using this variant has a special bond with the
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="planes.html#shadow">Plane of Shadow</a>, and gains several special abilities as he
advances in level.
<p>
At 1st level, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#hide">Hide</a> is treated as a class skill for the
illusionist.
</p>
<p>
At 5th level, the illusionist may add his Intelligence
modifier (in addition to his Dexterity modifier) to his <a style="color: #579EB6" href="skillsAll.html#hide">Hide</a> skill checks.
</p>
<p>
At 10th level the illusionist's illusions become infused with
shadow stuff from the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="planes.html#shadow">Plane of shadow</a>, making them more
realistic and more likely to fool the senses. The save DCs of
the illusionist's illusion spells increase by +1. This
benefit stacks with similar bonuses, such as from <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#spell-focus">Spell
Focus</a>.
</p>
<p>
At 15th level, the illusionist can hide in plain sight (as
the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="ranger.html">ranger</a> ability, except that the illusionist need not be
in natural terrain).
</p>
<p>
At 20th level, the illusionist gains the ability to blend
into shadows. In any condition of illumination that would
normally grant the illusionist concealment, he instead gains
total concealment (as if he were <a style="color: #579EB6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible">invisible</a>).
</p>
<p>
An illusionist using this variant does not gain bonus feats
for advancing as a wizard.
</p>
<h6><a id="illusion-mastery"></a>
Illusion Mastery (Ex)
</h6>
An illusionist using this variant automatically adds two
illusion spells to his spellbook every time he gains a level
that grants access to a new spell level. Furthermore, any
time the illusionist learns a new illusion spell, he treats
that spell as if be had mastered it with the <a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#spell-mastery">Spell Mastery</a>
feat.
<p>
An illusionist using this variant does not gain additional
spells per day for being a specialist wizard.
</p>
<h5><a id="necromancer"></a>
NECROMANCER VARIANTS
</h5>
Wrapped in mystery and burdened by reputations of evil,
necromancers control dangerous energies that rob the living
of strength and grant unlife to the dead. The most powerful
necromancers command dangerous undead minions and threaten
towns, cities, and sometimes even entire kingdoms with their
power. Although necromancers make excellent villains and
nemeses for a group of adventurers, neutral- and good-aligned
necromancers who view themselves as the shepherds of the
living and guardians of the dead can also prove valuable
allies.
<p>
Campaigns that include evil necromancers or groups of undead
as antagonists can benefit from the inclusion of variant
necromancers. Rival groups of necromancers might view certain
types of undead as the only true or "pure" undead and all
others as evils that must be destroyed, with each group
disagreeing on which types are which. Other factions or
groups might have an innate loathing for undead raised by any
but themselves.

<h6><a id="skeletal-minion"></a>
Skeletal Minion
</h6>
A 1st-level necromancer using this variant can begin play
with an undead minion (a human warrior <a style="color: #579EB6" href="monstersS.html#skeleton">skeleton</a>).
Obtaining this minion takes 24 hours and uses up magical
materials that cost 100 gp.
<p>
This creature is a loyal servant that follows the
necromancer's commands and accompanies her on adventures if
desired. If the skeletal minion is destroyed, the necromancer
suffers no ill effects and may replace it by performing a
ceremony identical to the one that allowed her to obtain her
first servant.
</p>
<p>
At 1st level, the skeleton is completely typical, but it
gains power as the necromancer gains levels. The skeleton has
a number of Hit Dice equal to the necromancer's class level.
Add one-half the necromancer's class level to the skeleton's
natural armor bonus. Add one-third of the necromancer's class
level to the skeleton's Strength and Dexterity scores.
</p>
<p>
A necromancer using this variant permanently gives up the
ability to obtain a familiar.
</p>
<h6><a id="undead-apotheosis"></a>
Undead Apotheosis (Ex)
</h6>
As a necromancer using this variant progresses in levels, she
gains some of the qualities that typify undead creatures.
<p>
At 5th level, the necromancer gains a 2 bonus on all saving
throws made to resist sleep, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned">stun</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#paralyzed">paralysis</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#poison">poison</a>, or
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#disease">disease</a>. This bonus increases to +4 at 15th level.
</p>
<p>
At 10th level, the necromancer gains a +4 bonus on saving
throws made to resist <a style="color: #579EB6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#ability-damaged">ability damage</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#ability-drained">ability drain</a>, or
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#energy-drained">energy drain</a>.
</p>
<p>
At 20th level, the necromancer gains 25% resistance to
critical hits, as the light
fortification <a style="color: #579EB6" href="magicItemsAW.html">armor special ability</a>.
</p>
<p>
A necromancer using this variant does not gain bonus feats
for advancing as a wizard.
</p>
<h6><a id="enhanced-undead"></a>
Enhanced Undead (Ex)
</h6>
Any time a necromancer using this variant creates an undead
creature (such as with <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsAtoB.html#animate-dead">animate dead</a>, <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsC.html#create-undead">create undead</a>, or <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsC.html#create-greater-undead">create
greater undead</a>), all undead creatures created gain a +4
enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity, and two
additional hit points per Hit Die. This ability does not
affect the number or Hit Dice of animated creatures that the
necromancer can create or control.
<p>
A necromancer using this variant does not gain additional
spells per day for being a specialist wizard.
</p>
<h5><a id="transmuter"></a>
TRANSMUTER VARIANTS
</h5>
Masters of change, transmuters are among the most varied and
versatile specialists. Transmutation spells, by their very
nature, can change the environment and allow the spellcaster
to solve nearly any problem.
<p>
This school's utility and variety ensures that nearly any
campaign's magic becomes richer with the introduction of
variant transmuters. Campaigns in which the magic system is
undergoing change benefit from introducing variant
transmuters. Likewise, campaigns that include an
above-average number of magical cultures or a long history of
magical sophistication benefit from alternative traditions of
transmutation magic.
</p>
<h6><a id="enhance-attribute"></a>
Enhance Attribute (Ex)
</h6>
Once per day, plus one additional time per five class levels,
a transmuter using this variant can add a +2 enhancement
bonus to any one of his ability scores. This bonus lasts for
a number of minutes equal to the transmuter's class level.
Using this ability is a free action (and counts as using a
<a style="color: #579EB6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">quickened</a> spell, so it may only be used once per round).
<p>
A transmuter using this variant permanently gives up the
ability to obtain a familiar.
</p>
<h6><a id="spell-versatility"></a>
Spell Versatility (Ex)
</h6>
A 5th-level transmuter using this variant can adapt magic of
other schools to his own style of spellcasting. For every
five class levels that the transmuter gains, he can select
one spell of any spell level that he has access to and treat
it as if it were a transmutation spell. This means, for
example, that the specialist can learn the spell normally and
even prepare it as a bonus spell from the transmutation
school. This spell can even be from a school that he has
chosen as a prohibited school. Once a spell is chosen to be
affected by this ability, it cannot be changed.
<p>
For example, a transmutation specialist using this variant
has selected abjuration and necromancy as his prohibited
schools. At 5th level, he gains access to 3rd-level spells.
He chooses <a style="color: #579EB6" href="spellsDtoE.html#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a> and forever after treats dispel magic
as if were a transmutation spell.
</p>
<p>
A transmuter using this variant does not gain bonus feats for
advancing as a wizard.
</p>
<h6><a id="transmutable-memory"></a>
Transmutable Memory (Ex)
</h6>
A transmuter using this variant can alter some of his
prepared spells in a short amount of time. Once per day, the
transmuter can give up a number of prepared spell levels (up
to a maximum total equal to half his class level) and prepare
different spells in their place, as long as the number of
newly prepared spell levels is equal to or less than the
number of spell levels given up (0-level spells don't count).
For example, a 12th-level transmuter who uses this variant
can lose two 1st-level spells and two 2nd-level spells from
memory (a total of six spell levels, half the character's
class level) and prepare two 3rd-level spells.
<p>
Using this ability requires a number of minutes of
concentration equal to the number of spell levels given up.
if the transmuter's concentration is broken during this time,
all spells to be lost are gone and no spells are gained in
their place.
</p>
<p>
A transmuter using this variant does not gain additional
spells per day for being a specialist wizard.
