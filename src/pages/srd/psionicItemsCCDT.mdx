Cognizance crystals store power points that psionic characters can use
to pay for manifesting their powers.
<a id="cognizance-crystal-physical-description"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description:</span>
A cognizance crystal consists of a core crystal and two or three
smaller crystals arranged in specific positions around it on strands of
silver wire. The crystals give off a faint glow. A typical cognizance
crystal weighs approximately 1 pound, has AC 7, 10 hit points, a
hardness of 8, and a break DC of 16.</p>
<a id="cognizance-crystal-activation"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> The user
must merely hold or have a crystal on her person for a period of at
least 10 minutes (which is long enough to attune oneself to the
crystal). Thereafter, the owner can use power points stored in the
crystal to manifest powers she knows.</p>
<p>The maximum number of points a cognizance crystal can store is
always an odd number and is never more than 17. It can store only as
many power points as its original maximum, set at the time of its
creation. When a cognizance crystal&#8217;s power points are used up, the
glow of the crystal dims. However, the user can recharge it by paying
power points on a 1-for-1 basis. While doing this depletes the user&#8217;s
own power point reserve for the day, those power points remain
available in the cognizance crystal until used.</p>
<p>A user cannot directly replenish her personal power points
from those stored in a cognizance crystal, nor can she draw power
points from more than one source to manifest a power. See Using Stored
Power Points for more information.</p>

<p class="initial">A dorje is a slender crystal that contains a
single power. Each dorje has 50 charges when created, and each charge
expended allows one use of that power. A dorje that runs out of charges
is just a simple crystal.
</p>
<a id="dorje-physical-description"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description:</span>
A typical dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless),
between 8 inches and 10 inches long and about 1/2 inch thick, which can
weigh up to 1/4 pound. Occasionally, a dorje is decorated with carvings
or inscribed runes along a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC
7, 7 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.</p>
<a id="dorje-activation"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> Dorjes use
the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a
dorje is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. (If the power being manifested has a manifesting time
longer than 1 standard action, however, it takes that long to manifest
the power from a dorje.) The user must have the power on his class
list, even if he knows the command thought. Additionally, to activate a
dorje, a character must hold it in hand and point it in the general
direction of the target or area to be affected.</p>
<p>Dorjes are normally created at the minimum manifester level
required to manifest the power, and powers that can be augmented are
not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje&#8217;s wielder cannot augment
the power contained within the dorje. However, dorjes can be created at
a higher manifester level than required to manifest the power. In this
case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is augmented, to the
limit of the manifester level and the power&#8217;s augmentation maximums, if
any. The manifester level of a dorje cannot be more than five higher
than the minimum manifester level to use the power it contains.</p>

</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>

</table>
<p>Psionic tattoos are designs scribed on the skin that manifest
powers on their wearers. The wearer doesn&#8217;t get to make any decisions
about the tattoo&#8217;s effect - the manifester who scribed it has already
done so.</p>
<p>Psionic tattoos can vary in size, but a creature can wear only
a total of twenty tattoos at one time - attempting to add one more than
this maximum causes all previously scribed tattoos to simultaneously
activate. A psionic tattoo fades away after use.</p>
<a id="psionic-tattoo-psysical-description"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description:</span>
A typical psionic tattoo is a colorful pattern of tiny, interlacing
lines within a larger design. This design can be as simple as a circle
or a star, or as complex as an artist wishes to make it. Once it is
scribed, a tattoo&#8217;s design does not change. A psionic tattoo usually
covers an area of skin no more than 5 inches in diameter (larger ones
could be designed, but would have no added effect).</p>
<a id="scribing-and-transferring-tattoos"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scribing and Transferring
Tattoos:</span> The manifester level of a psionic tattoo is the minimum
level required to manifest the scribed power. A psionic tattoo can
contain only powers of 3rd level or lower.</p>
<p>A psionic tattoo inscribed on a wearer is potentially more
mobile than a mundane tattoo. As a standard action, the wearer can will
the tattoo to move to a different part of his body or onto the skin of
any willing (or unconscious) living creature he touches. If the wearer
of a psionic tattoo is rendered unconscious or is slain, another
sentient creature can touch the tattoo while willing it to leave the
previous wearer and apply itself to the new creature as a standard
action. Psionic tattoos cannot overlay one another.</p>
<a id="identifying-psionic-tattoos"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying Psionic Tattoos:</span>
In addition to the standard methods of identification, the wearer of a
tattoo can concentrate on it and attempt to gain some sense of how it
would feel if activated. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check provides
a hint to the tattoo&#8217;s effect. </p>
<a id="psionic-tattoo-activation"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> A psionic
tattoo produces its effect when touched by its wearer and willed to do
so. This activity, called &#8220;tapping&#8221; the tattoo, is a standard action
that provokes attacks of opportunity. A psionic tattoo fades away after
use.</p>
<p>The following rules govern the use of psionic tattoos.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A creature must have an appropriate physical surface on
which to scribe the pattern (thus, incorporeal creatures or creatures
with impermanent flesh, such as fire elementals, cannot use psionic
tattoos).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tapping a psionic tattoo provokes attacks of opportunity.
A successful attack (including <a href="specialAttacks.html#grapple"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">grappling</a> attacks) against the
wearer
forces a <a href="psionicSkills.html#concentration"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Concentration</a> check. A wearer
who fails this check cannot
concentrate effectively on the tattoo to use it. The tattoo remains
untapped, and the wearer can make another attempt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A character can trigger the effects of another&#8217;s psionic
tattoo if the other wearer is unconscious. It is a full-round action to
find, touch, and concentrate on an unconscious creature&#8217;s tattoo in
order to tap it. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The manifester level for a standard psionic tattoo is the
minimum manifester level needed to manifest the power (unless otherwise
specified).
