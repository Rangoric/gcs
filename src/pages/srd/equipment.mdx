### WEALTH AND MONEY

##### COINS

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A
gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10
copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins,
there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.

The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to
the pound).

##### SELLING LOOT

In general, a character can sell something for
half its listed price.

Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade
good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged
almost as if it were cash itself.
