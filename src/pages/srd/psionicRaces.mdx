<p class="initial">+2 Charisma, -2 Strength, -2 Wisdom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monstrous Humanoid: Dromites are not subject to spells or
effects that
affect humanoids only, such as <a href="spellsC.html#charm-person"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">charm person</a> or <a
href="spellsDtoE.html#dominate-person"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dominate person</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small: As a Small creature, a dromite gains a +1 size
bonus to Armor
Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on <a
href="skillsAll.html#hide" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Hide</a>
checks, but it uses smaller weapons than humans use, and its lifting
and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dromite base land speed is 20 feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a id="dromite-chitin"></a><p>Chitin: A dromite&#8217;s skin is hardened, almost like an
exoskeleton, and
grants the character a +3 natural armor bonus to AC and one of the
following kinds of <a href="monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">resistance to energy</a>: cold 5,
electricity 5, fire 5,
or sonic 5. The player chooses what type of energy resistance is gained
when the character is created. (This choice also dictates which caste
the dromite belongs to.) This natural energy resistance stacks with any
future energy resistance gained through other effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naturally Psionic: Dromites gain 1 bonus power point at
1st level. This
benefit does not grant them the ability to manifest powers unless they
gain that ability through another source, such as levels in a psionic
class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psi-Like Ability: 1/day-<a
href="psionicPowersDtoF.html#energy-ray"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">energy ray</a>. A dromite always
deals
the kind of
energy damage that its chitin has resistance to (for example, a dromite
who has resistance to cold 5 deals cold damage with its energy ray).
Manifester level is equal to 1/2 Hit Dice (minimum 1st). The save DC is
Charisma-based.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scent: Its antennae give a dromite the scent ability. A
dromite can
detect opponents by scent within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind,
the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet.
Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at
twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk
or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When a
dromite detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not
revealed - only its presence somewhere within range. The dromite can
take a
move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the dromite
comes within 5 feet of the source, the dromite pinpoints the source&#8217;s
location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blind-Fight: Its antennae also give a dromite <a
href="featsAll.html#blind-fighting" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Blind-Fight</a>
as a bonus feat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a id="dromite-compound-eyes"></a><p>Compound Eyes: This feature of its anatomy gives a dromite
a +2 racial bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#spot"

<li>
<p>Medium: As Medium creatures, duergar have no special
bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duergar base land speed is 20 feet. However, gray dwarves
can move at
this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a
medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in
such situations).</p>

<p>Darkvision out to 120 feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immunity to paralysis, phantasms, and poison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like
effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a id="duergar-stability"></a><p>Stability: Duergar are exceptionally stable on their feet.
A duergar
receives a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being <a
href="specialAttacks.html#bull-rush" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">bull
rushed </a>or <a href="specialAttacks.html#trip"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">tripped</a> when standing on the
ground (but not when climbing, flying,
riding or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).</p>
</li>
<li>
<a id="duergar-stonecunning"></a><p>Stonecunning: This ability grants a duergar a +2 racial
bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#search"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a>
checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework,
traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe
stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that
isn&#8217;t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual
stonework.
A gray dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can
make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a duergar can
use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A duergar
can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as
naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Duergar have a sixth
sense about stonework, an innate ability that they get plenty of
opportunity to practice and hone in their underground homes.</p>

<p>+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the

is treated as one size
larger if doing so is advantageous to him.
A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining
whether a creature&#8217;s special attacks based on size (such as improved
grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons
designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his
space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The
