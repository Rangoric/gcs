Flaws are like the flip side of feats. Whereas a feat enables a character
to be better than normal at performing a task (or even to do something
that normal characters can't), a flaw restricts a character's capabilities
or imposes a penalty of some sort.
<p>
A player may select up to two flaws when creating a character. After 1st
level, a character cannot take on additional flaws unless the game master
specifically allows it (for examples of times when doing this might be
appropriate, see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unearthedTraits.html">Character
Traits</a>). Each flaw a player selects entitles his character to a bonus
feat. In other words, when you create a character, if you select two
flaws, you can also take two bonus feats beyond those your character would
be normally entitled to.
</p>
<p>
Unlike <a style="color: #579eb6" href="unearthedTraits.html">traits</a>, flaws
are entirely negative in their impact on a character's capabilities.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: CREATING FLAWS
</h5>
You can create new flaws, but be careful: Flaws can unbalance your game.
When creating flaws, keep a few issues in mind:
<ul>
<li><p>A flaw must have a numeric effect on a character's specific
capabilities. Flaws with primarily roleplaying or story effects have
unpredictable effects on game balance.
</p></li>
<li><p>Flaws are generally bigger in magnitude than feats. That's because
players always choose flaws that have the least impact on their
characters, while taking feats that have the most. For example, while a
feat affecting skills grants a +2 bonus on two skills, its counterpart
flaw might impose a -4 penalty on two skills.
</p></li>
<li><p>A flaw must have a meaningful effect regardless of character class or
role. That way, a player can't reduce the flaw's importance through
multiclassing. For instance, a flaw that only affects spellcasters might
seem reasonable - but for nonspellcaster characters, the flaw likely proves
meaningless. Even if you restrict the selection of such feats to
characters of specific classes, a player can easily select a spellcasting
class at 1st level, choose two flaws that apply to spellcasters, gain the
bonus feats, multiclass into a nonspellcasting class at 2nd level and
thereafter proceed as a primarily nonspellcasting character. The player
has sacrificed a level to gain two bonus feats, a tradeoff that appeals to
some players.
</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, a flaw that penalizes a character's Charisma based
skill checks only
has a significant impact on the party spokesperson - the quiet fighter or
barbarian likely won't feel any impact from the penalties.
</p></li>
</ul>
