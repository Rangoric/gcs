<p class="initial">If you buy a class skill, your character gets
1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each skill
point. If you buy other classes&#8217; skills (cross-class skills), you get
1/2 rank per skill point. Your maximum rank in a class skill is your
character level + 3. Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is
one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p>
<a id="skill-check"></a><p><b>Using Skills</b>: To make a skill check, roll:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank +
ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw&#8212;
the higher the roll, the better. Either you&#8217;re trying to match or
exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you&#8217;re trying to beat
another character&#8217;s check result.</p>
<a id="skill-ranks"></a><p><b>Skill Ranks</b>: A character&#8217;s number of ranks in a skill
is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill.
Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them;
doing this is called making an untrained skill check.</p>
<a id="ability-modifier"></a><p><b>Ability Modifier</b>: The ability modifier used in a skill
check is the modifier for the skill&#8217;s key ability (the ability
associated with the skill&#8217;s use). The key ability of each skill is
noted in its description.</p>
<a id="miscellaneous-modifiers"></a><p><b>Miscellaneous Modifiers</b>: Miscellaneous modifiers
include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by
feats, among others.</p>
<p>Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in
that skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character&#8217;s class
skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your
character 1/2 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not
found on your character&#8217;s class skill list. (Half ranks do not improve
your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can&#8217;t save skill
points to spend later.</p>
<p>The maximum rank in a class skill is the character&#8217;s level +
3. If it&#8217;s a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number
(do not round up or down).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or
a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes,
your maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p class="initial">When your character uses a skill, you make a
skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of
the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result
must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an
opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the
task, the higher the number you need to roll.</p>
<p>Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free
to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid
simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over
again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character
may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.</p>
<a id="skills-checks"></a><h5>SKILL CHECKS</h5>
<p class="initial">A skill check takes into account a character&#8217;s
training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the
die roll). It may also take into account his or her race&#8217;s knack for
doing certain things (racial bonus) or what armor he or she is wearing
(armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among
other things. </p>
<p>To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character&#8217;s
skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the
character&#8217;s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that
skill&#8217;s key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may
apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher
the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a
natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a
natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.</p>
<a id="difficulty-class"></a><a id="dc"></a><h6>Difficulty Class</h6>
<p class="initial">Some checks are made against a Difficulty
Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a
guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order
to succeed.</p>

<a id="opposed-checks"></a><h6>Opposed Checks</h6>
<p class="initial">An opposed check is a check whose success or
failure is determined by comparing the check result to another
character&#8217;s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result
succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher
skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break
the tie.</p>

<a id="trying-again"></a><h6>Trying Again</h6>
<p class="initial">In general, you can try a skill check again if
you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however,
have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few
skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to
accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has
succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.</p>
<a id="untrained-skill-checks"></a><h6>Untrained Skill Checks</h6>
<p class="initial">Generally, if your character attempts to use a
skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The
skill modifier doesn&#8217;t have a skill rank added in because the character
has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the
modifier for the skill&#8217;s key ability, are applied to the check.</p>
<p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>
<a id="favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions"></a><h6>Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</h6>
<p class="initial">Some situations may make a skill easier or
harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier
for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.</p>
<p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into
account exceptional circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li>Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent
conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool
for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill
Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.</li>
<li>Give the skill user a &#8211;2 circumstance penalty to represent
conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use
improvised tools or having misleading information.</li>
<li>Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the
task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can
be subpar.</li>
<li>Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make
the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work
that must be flawless.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conditions that affect your character&#8217;s ability to perform the
skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the
character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to
the skill modifier and a reduction in the check&#8217;s DC have the same
result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent
different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.</p>
<a id="time-and-skill-checks"></a><h6>Time and Skill Checks</h6>
<p class="initial">Using a skill might take a round, take no
time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are
standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions
define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a
combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to
the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to
an event, or are included as part of an action. These skill checks are
not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p>
<a id="checks-without-rolls"></a><h6>Checks without Rolls</h6>
<p class="initial">A skill check represents an attempt to
accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or
distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more
favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.</p>
<a id="taking-10"></a><p><b>Taking 10</b>: When your character is not being threatened
or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for
the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For
many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful.
Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a
character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety
measure &#8212;you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but
fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the
average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where
a particularly high roll wouldn&#8217;t help.</p>
<a id="taking-20"></a><p><b>Taking 20</b>:When you have plenty of time (generally 2
minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one
full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no
threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no
penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you
will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20
for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a
20. Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it
assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes
twenty times as long as making a single check would take. Since taking
20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding,
if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for
failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties
before he or she could complete the task. Common &#8220;take 20&#8221; skills
include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.</p>
<a id="ability-checks-and-caster-level-checks"></a><p><b>Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks</b>: The normal take
10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to
caster level checks.</p>
<a id="combining-skill-attempts"></a><h5>COMBINING SKILL ATTEMPTS</h5>
<p class="initial">When more than one character tries the same
skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may
overlap.</p>
<a id="individual-events"></a><h6>Individual Events</h6>
<p class="initial">Often, several characters attempt some action
and each succeeds or fails independently. The result of one character&#8217;s
Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb
check.</p>
<a id="aid-another"></a><h6>Aid Another</h6>
<p class="initial">You can help another character achieve success
on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a
cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the
character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per
the rule for favorable conditions. (You can&#8217;t take 10 on a skill check
to aid another.) In many cases, a character&#8217;s help won&#8217;t be beneficial,
or only a limited number of characters can help at once. </p>
<p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain
results you can&#8217;t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your
character couldn&#8217;t achieve alone.</p>
<a id="skill-synergy"></a><h6>Skill Synergy</h6>
<p class="initial">It&#8217;s possible for a character to have two
skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in
one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of
its synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some
cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in
question, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other
checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use
certain class features.</p>
<a id="ability-checks"></a><h5>ABILITY CHECKS</h5>
<p class="initial">Sometimes a character tries to do something to
which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an
ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate
ability modifier. Essentially, you&#8217;re making an untrained skill check. </p>
<p>In some cases, an action is a straight test of one&#8217;s ability
with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn&#8217;t make a height check to see
who is taller, you don&#8217;t make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</p>

common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills
for purposes other than those noted here.</p>
<p>Here is the format for skill descriptions.</p>
<a id="skill-name"></a><h5>SKILL NAME</h5>
<p class="initial">The skill name line includes (in addition to
the name of the skill) the following information.</p>
<a id="skill-key-ability"></a><p><b>Key Ability</b>: The abbreviation of the ability whose
modifier applies to the skill check. Exception: <a
href="skillsAll.html#speak-language" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Speak
Language</a> has &#8220;None&#8221; as its key ability because the use of this
skill does not require a check.</p>
<a id="skill-trained-only"></a><p><b>Trained Only</b>: If this notation is included in the skill
name line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If it
is omitted, the skill can be used untrained (with a rank of 0). If any
special notes apply to trained or untrained use, they are covered in
the Untrained section (see below).</p>
<a id="skill-armor-check-penalty"></a><p><b>Armor Check Penalty</b>: If this notation is included in
the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate)
to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check
penalty does not apply.</p>
<p>The skill name line is followed by a general description of
what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other
types of information:</p>
<a id="check"></a><p><b>Check</b>: What a character (&#8220;you&#8221; in the skill
description) can do with a successful skill check and the check&#8217;s DC.</p>
<a id="skill-action"></a><p><b>Action</b>: The type of action using the skill requires, or
the amount of time required for a check.</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Any conditions that apply to successive
attempts to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn&#8217;t allow you
to attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an
inherent penalty (such as with the <a href="skillsAll.html#climb"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Climb</a> skill), you can&#8217;t take 20.
If this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried without any
inherent penalty, other than the additional time required.</p>
<a id="skill-special"></a><p><b>Special</b>: Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such
as special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain
characters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.</p>
<p><b>Synergy</b>: Some skills grant a bonus to the use of one or
more other skills because of a synergistic effect. This entry, when
present, indicates what bonuses this skill may grant or receive because
of such synergies. See Table 4&#8211;5 for a complete list of bonuses granted
by synergy between skills (or between a skill and a class feature).</p>
<a id="skill-restriction"></a><p><b>Restriction</b>: The full utility of certain skills is
restricted to characters of certain classes or characters who possess
certain feats. This entry indicates whether any such restrictions exist
for the skill.</p>
<a id="skill-untrained"></a><p><b>Untrained</b>: This entry indicates what a character
without at least 1 rank in the skill can do with it. If this entry
doesn&#8217;t appear, it means that the skill functions normally for
untrained characters (if it can be used untrained) or that an untrained
character can&#8217;t attempt checks with this skill (for skills that are
designated as &#8220;Trained Only&#8221;).</p>
