<h2>Unearthed Arcana</h2>
<h3><a id="spontaneous-metamagic"></a>SPONTANEOUS METAMAGIC</h3>
One of the more radical concepts recently introduced to the D&#38;D game is the metamagic
feat. These feats allow spellcasters to tinker with their spells' range, area, damage,
components required, and even casting time. While such options existed in previous
editions of the game, they usually required the caster to use other spells to affect
his magic, tather than relying on pure talent.
<p>However, this new option comes with a significant cost, particularly for those
casters who prepare spells (such as clerics, druids, and wizards). Such characters
must plan in advance which spells they wish to use their metamagic feats on, and
prepare those spells in the appropriate higher-level spells slot. This requirement
forces the character to guess which spells will be needed in which situations. If
a caster anticipates being grappled, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#still-spell">stilled spell</a> would be extraordinarily valuable
- but which one? If a character expects to be sneaking around, she should consider
using <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#silent-spell">Silent Spell</a> on one or more of her
spells - but how many? In many cases, these choices are for naught, since the caster
ends up using her silent <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile">magic missile</a>
in ordinary combat or her enlarged <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsFtoG#fireball">fireball</a> in
a space to small to take advantage of the expanded range.</p>
<p>Characters who son't prepare spells in advance (such as bards and sorcerers)
have a distict advantage in that they can choose to use their metamagic feats "on
the fly"; that is, at the time of casting. The cost is an extended casting time
(making <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a> a useless option
for such characters), but this cost is rarely balanced with that paid by other spellcasters.</p>
<p>The two variant systems descibed below give more variety and options to the metamagic-using
spellcaster. With either of these variants, a spellcaster doesn't have to prepare
metamagic versions of her spells in advance (if she normally prepares spells) or
spend full-round actions to cast metamagic spells (if she doesn't prepare spells).
Nor do metamagic spells take up higher-level spell slots.</p>
<p>Instead the "cost" for using a metamagic feat is applied in one of two different
manners. The first applies the cost as additional spell slots. The second restricts
the number of times per day the feat can be used.</p>
<p>Regardless of the variant you use, the Insidious Magic and Tenacious Magic feats
(both from the <i>Forgotten Realms(R) Campaign Setting</i>) don't use the normal
metamagic rules. Since they automatically affect all of a caster's spells, they
never require higher-level slots or have any limit on the maximum spell level affected.</p>
<p>For both of these variants, the prerequisites for selecting a metamagic feat,
and the effects of the feat itself, remain the same as given in the feats' descriptions
(except when otherwise noted).</p>
<h5><a id="daily-uses"></a>DAILY USES</h5>
With this variant, a character who selects a metamagic feat gains three daily uses
of that feat that she can opt to use "on the fly" without previous preparation,
increased spell level, or extended casting time. Tha character must decide when
casting the spell if she wishes to apply the effect of one of her metamagic feats
to the spell.
<p>The macimum level of spell to which a caster can apply a metamagic feat is equal
to the maximum spell level she is capable of casting (based on her level and ability
scores), minus the spell level adjustment of the metamagic feat. If the result of
this calculation is less than 0, the character can't apply the metamagic feat to
any of her spells.</p>
<p>For instance, a 5th-level wizard is normally capable of casting spells of up
to 3rd level. If she chooses to apply her <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#silent-spell">Silent Spell</a>
metamagic feat (which uses a spell slot one level higher than normal) to a spell,
the maximum level of spell that she can apply it to is equal to 3 minus 1, or 2nd.
Thus, she may make any of her 0-, 1st-, or 2nd-level spells silent. If she had the
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#maximize-spell">Maximize Spells</a> feat, she could apply
it only to 0-level spells (since a maximized spell is normally cast as a spell three
levels higher, and 3 minus 3 is 0). <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a>
woulc be of no use to this wizard, since she couldn't even apply is to 0-level spells.</p>
<p>A caster can apply more than one metamagic feat to a spell, or even the same
metamagic effect more than once (if allowed by the feat's description). However,
to determine the maximum level of spell that can be so affected, add together all
the spell level adjustments given for the various feats. A 9th-level wizard could
enlarge and empower any spell of 2nd level of lower (since her maximum spell level
is 5th, and the total spell level adjustment for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#empower-spell">Empower Spell</a>
and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#enlarge-spell">Enlarge Spell</a> is 3). If a feat may
be applied more than once to the same spell (such as Empower Spell), each application
counts as one of the caster's three daily uses.</p>
<p>Each time a character selects a metamagic feat, she gains three daily uses of
that feat- Multiple selections of the same feat are cumulative. For instance, if
a caster selects <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#empower-spell">Empower Spell</a> twice,
she may use the feat six times per day rather than three.</p>
<p>In this variant system, the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#heighten-spell">Heighten Spell</a>
feat functions slightly differently from other metamagic feats. You may use the
Heighten Spell feat to increase a spell's effective level (for purposes of such
factors as save DCs and so on) up to the maximum spell level you are capable of
casting. For instance, a 3rd-level cleric could heighten a 0-, or 1st-level spell
to 2nd-level, while a 7th-level druid could heighten a 0- through 8th-level spell
to 9th level. The spell is treated as a spell of that level for purposes of save
DC and similar effects, but doesn't require a higher-level spell slot.</p>
<h5><a id="extra-spell-slots"></a>EXTRA SPELL SLOTS</h5>
With this variant, a caster mist expend ectra spell slots in order to apply the
effects of a metamagic feat. These spell slots must be of a level equal to or higher
than that of the spell being modified by the metamagic feat. In essence, the character
pays for the metamagic effect by "using up" other spells of the same of higher level.
The caster need not prepare the metamagic version of the spell ahead of time, and
the spell's actual level and casting time are unchanged from normal.
<p>The number of extra spell slots required is equal to the spell level adjustment
of the feat. For example, a wizard who wants to cast a quickened <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile">magic missile</a>
would expend the magic missile spell, plus four additional spells of 1st-level or
higher.</p>
<p>If the caster has more than one spellcasting class, all extra spell slots expended
must come from the same spellcasting class as the spell to be modified. A 7th-level
cleric/4th-level wizard who wants to cast a maximized <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#cure-moderate-wounds">cure moderate wounds</a>
can't spend any of her wizard spell slots - they all must be from her cleric spellcasting
ability.</p>
<p>A character may only expend bonus eplls from school specilization on spells of
that school (so an evoker could speld her bonus 3rd-level evocation spell to pay
for a metamagic feat applied to another evocation spell, but not to a spell of any
other school). She can't expend domain spells to pay for a metamagic feat's added
spell slot cost, even if the spell is a domain spell.</p>
<p>In the case of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#heighten-spell">Heighten Spell</a>
feat, a caster expends one additional spell slot for each effective level she wishes
to add to the spell. To heighten a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsFtoG.html#fireball">fireball</a>
to the equivalent of a 5th-level spell, a caster must expend two extra spell slots
of 3rd level or higher.</p>
<p>A caster can apply more than one metamagic feat to a spell, or even the same
metamagic feat more than once (ig allowed by the feat's description). She must simply
pay the additional cost in spell slots. Fir instance, a wizard casting a stilled
and silent <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#invisibility">invisibility</a> spell would spend
two spell slots in addition to the invisibility spell: one for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#still-spell">Still Spell</a>
and a second for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#silent-spell">Silent Spell</a>.</p>
<p>If a caster doesn't have enough remaining spell slots to cast the metamagic spell,
she can't apply that metamagic effect to the spell.</p>
<h5><a id="combining-the-variants"></a>COMBINING THE VARIANTS</h5>
You could combine the two metamagic variants presented above. Using a combined system,
a metamagic-enhanced spell would cost additional slots (as noted in the second variant),
but the caster would have a maximum spell level to which she could apply her metamagic
feats (as in the first variant). This combined approach limits the immediate effect
of metamagic feats in the game (because of the spell level limit) while simultaneously
assigning a very real cost to their use (additional spell slots).
<h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-spontaneous-metamagic"></a>BEHIND THE CURTAIN: SPONTANEOUS METAMAGIC</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">The first variant limits the immediate effect of metamagic feats on a character's
power level, just as in the standard rules. A character who picks up <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a>
can't immediately begin quickening her most powerful spells - she must initially
be content using the feat only on her weakest spells. Again as with the standard
rules, the variant establishes a default "minimum caster level" for each feat, since
the feats are useless until a caster is capable og casting spells of high enough
level to take advantage of the metamagic feat.
<p>Unlike in the standard rules, however, a character with a metamagic feat need not
weigh the value of a metamagic-affected spell against a spell of a higher level.
The caster doen't have to decide whether she'd rather have an empowered <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile">magic missile</a>
or a normal <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#ligtning-bolt">lightning bolt</a>, since the
empowered magic missile doesn't require a higher-level spell slot than normal.
A character using the first variant - particularly one who must prepare spells ahead
of time - almost certainly uses her metamagic feats much more often than she would
withuot the variant. As first, it may seem as if the character has gained significant
power, but that's to be expected when a new oprion becomes available. Ultimately,
the limit of daily uses keeps this new ability from getting out of hand, and the
simple fact that the character had to spend a feat slot to gain the ability in the
first place is still a balancing factor.</p>
<p>The second variant is both more and less restrictive than either the standard version
of metamagic or the first variant. On one hand, a character whi relies on metamagic
feats to boost her spell power goes through her available spells at a dramatically
faster rate. A spellcaster who isn't careful could find her entire spell selection
drained by a single battle!</p>
<p>On the other hand, this variant allows a spellcaster to apply a metamagic feat to
her most powerful spells right away. A 9th-level caster whi picks up <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a>
can quicken even her 5th-level spells - but at a cost of four additional 5th-level
spell slots, which few 9th-level spellcasters have. This means that metamagic feats
have a more dramatic effect on combat, as characters "juice up" their most powerful
spells from the moment they select the feat.</p></div>

style="border: 0px solid ; width: 73px; height: 75px;" /></a>
With this variant, casters can produce more potent spells by using a rare and exotic
metamagic component in the casting of a spell, in place of the spells's standard
material component (or in addition to the spell's other components, if it has no
material component).
<p>
A spellcaster who uses a metamagic component casts a spell as if a specific metamagic
feat had been applied to the spell. The casting process otherwise functions as it
would if the character cast the standard version of the spell. For example, a wizard
can cast a widened <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsFtoG.html#fireball">fireball</a> by using a 1,900 gp fire opal (the metamagic
component) instead of a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur (the material component).
A wizard doesn't neet to prepare such a spell as a higher-level spell, and a sorcerer
doesn't use a higher-level spell slot or take a full-round action to cast the spell.
A spellcaster can use a metamagic component without having the relevant metamagic
feat. The spellcaster merely chooses at the moment of casting whether to employ the
material component (if any) given in the spell description or the metamagic component
given in these variant rules. In either case, the casting process consumes the material
component or metamagic component.
</p>
<p>
A character can't use a metamagic components to add the effect of a metamagic feat
to a spell or effect created by a magic item. If a spell has an arcane material
component or a divine forcus (shown in the spell description as M/DF), then a divine
spellcaster must have the relevant metamagic component in addition to his holy symbol.
Som spells that have expensive material components can't be made more potent by
the use of metamagic components, and a few spells don't have metamagic components
because there's no useful way to add the effect of a metamagic feat to them.
</p>
<h5><a id="specific-metamagic-components"></a>SPECIFIC METAMAGIC COMPONENTS</h5>
Table: Metamagic Components (below) presents a list of metamagic components for
the spells in the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoZ.html">spells</a> sections of the srd. There's
plenty of room to add metamagic components unique to your campaign, because each
spell as presented here has only one metamagic component and thus only one metamagic
effect associated with it. Doing so is a good way to add specific flavor to your
campaign world. Perhaps all your metamagic components are chemical reagents, or
maybe the dwarves in your campaign truly only use uncut gems as metamagic components.
Truly evil spellcasters might use vile, disgusting metamagic components. Discovering
a new metamagic component is also a useful activity for spellcasters who have time
for spell research.
<p>
The table entires present a wide variety of metamagic components each belonging
to one of the following categories.
</p>
<h6><a id="expensive-versions-of-existing-metarial-components"></a>Expensive Versions of Existing Material Components</h6>
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#true-seeing">True seeing</a>, for example, requires a rare
ointment as a material component. It's easy enough to imagine that by using more
ointment, the spells duration can be extended. Just saying "more of the same" is
a fine metamagic component for spells that already have ecpensive material components.
It's also possible to design a metamagic component that's an expensive version of
a free material component. <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR#resilient-sphere">Resilient sphere</a>
has a hemispherical piece of clear crystal as its material component. It has no cost,
and you could find that piece of crystal in a spell component pouch. The spells
metamagic component is a sphere of pure crystal worth 850 gp - just an expensive
ersion of the material component given in the spell description.
<h6><a id="gems"></a>Gems</h6>
Many spells already require expensive gems as material componens, and players are
used to the idea that powerful magical effects sometimes require gemstones, whether
cut or ground into powder. Gems make good metamagic components (from a character's
point of view) becasue they're easy to carry around, they can be found as treasure,
an there's the established precendent of gemstones as a source of magic power. They're
a particularly good choice for particularly potent metamagic components (ones that
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#maximize-spell">maximize</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#widen-spell">widen</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">quicken</a> spells),
because gems can easily be woth 5,000 gp or more.
<h6><a id="jewelry-and-art-objects"></a>Jewelry and Art Objects</h6>
Jewelry - everything from aklets to headbands - and art objects such as statuettes
and carvings also make good choices for metamagic components. It feels appropriately
mystical to use a golden medallion as a metamagic component for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#hypnotism">hypnotism</a>,
for example. Like gems, jewelry and art objects seem to work well as particularly
expensive metamagic components because it's easy to imagine them being worth that
much, and they can be found in treasure hoards.
<h6><a id="other-treasure"></a>Other Treasure</h6>
Occasionally, a weapon or other bit of treasure (usually magical in nature) finds
its way into the metamagic component list when thematically appropriate. For characters
who face a lot of well-equipped NPCs, being able to use treasure as a metamagic
component is often a useful alternative to simply carrying an item back to town
to sell it. High-level characters who would ordinarily disdain a mere +1 enhancement
bonus might think twice if they know it's the metamagic component for a quickened
version of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#align-weapon">align weapon</a>.
<h6><a id="plant-based-metamagic-components"></a>Plant-Based Metamagic Components</h6>
Some spells, especially druid spells, have mushrooms, herbs, or other meramagic
components derived from rare plants carefully grown by experts. These metamagic
components, often reffered to as "druid-tended" items in Table: Metamagic Components,
have a potential advantage for PCs because some characters might have the ability
to grow and cultivate these plants - thereby saving some money.
<p>
To grow and harvest a plant-based metamagic component, a character mut first sow
and tend the seeds, which takes one month per 1,000 gp value (or fraction thereof)
of the metamagic component. At the end of that time, the character must make a
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#profession">Profession (herbalist)</a> check (DC 20 + 1 per
1,000 gp value of the metamagic component) in order to harvest the plant successfully.
A character can grow multiple metamagic components at a time, but each plant beyond
the first one being tended adds 1 to the DC of all Profession (herbalist) checks
made during that time.
</p>
<h6><a id="alchemical-metamagic-components"></a>Alchemical Metamagic Components</h6>
Alchemy provides another traditional source for metamagic components - there's a
strong fantasy archetype of the wizard comcocting powerful substances in his dank
laboratory. An entry in Table: Metamagic Components that contains some form of the
word "alchemical" is a metamagic component created by the use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#craft">Craft (alchemy)</a> skill.
<p>
When a character sets out to concoct an alchemical metamagic component, the rules
in the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#craft">Craft</a> skill description apply, except
that the calculations are done in gold pieces, not silver pieces. Any new alchemical
substance (such as the alchemical dreamwisp dust that is the metamagic componens
for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#sleep">sleep</a>) an anything alchemically treated or
alchemically prepared has a Craft (alchemy) DC of 15. Alchemically distilled metamagic
components (for example see ray of exhaustion) have a DC of 20, and alchemically
purified metamagic components (see polymorph any object) have a DC of 25.
</p>
<p>
Alchemical metamagic components can take a very long time to make, so they�re often
a poor choice (from a character's point of view) for particularly expensive metamagic
components.
</p>
<h6><a id="planar-metamagic-components"></a>Planar Metamagic Components</h6>
Some metamagic components come from places beyond the Material Plane, especially
in games where planar travel is common. The planes have exotic substances as well
as purer, enhanced versions of common substances, and it makes sense that (for instance)
rare soils from the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="planes.html#earth">Elemental Plane of Earth</a> might
make your <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#move-earth">move earth</a> spell more potent.
<p>
purity is a major consideration for metamagic components of this sort; obtaining
one is not simply a matter of going to the appropriate plane and scooping up a handfull
of stuff. In general, it takes a day of scavenging and a DC 30 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge (the planes)</a>
check to find enough of the relevant raw material in its purest form to serve as
a metamagic component. Because there's no raw materials cost, planar metamagic components
are a poor choice (from the DM's point of view) for more expensive metamagic components,
although this is ameliorated somewhat by the fact that it takes high-level spells
to reach other planes, and those other planes are perilous places.
</p>
<h6><a id="ritual-metamagic-components"></a>Ritual Metamagic Components</h6>
Some items become metamagic components after they have been prepared during a series
of ancient rituals. Performing the entire ritual takes one day for every 500 gp
(or fraction thereof) of the value of the metamagic component. At the end of that
time, the preparer must make a DC 25 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge (religion)</a>
check if the components is for a divine spell or a DC 25 Knowledge (arcana) check
if it's for an arcane spell in order to successfully finish the creation process.
<p>
Unless the item used for a ritual component has some intrinsic value, ritual metamagic
component can be poor choies for powerful metamagic and high-level spells (from
the DM's perspective), because a character with enough ranks in the relevant skill
need only spend the time to aquire the component.
</p>
<h6><a id="fanciful-metamagic-components"></a>Fanciful Metamagic Components</h6>
The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#darkness">darkness</a> spell has a metamagic component
of "coal mined and kept in total darkness." While evocative, such an item is not
necessarily hard for the PCs to obtain - although there's an inherent disadvantage
involved because the component can become "spoiled" - a consideration that doesn't
affect the other kinds of metamagic components. For instance, if the coal needed
for a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#darkness">darkness</a> spell (or the oil needed for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellDtoE#deeper-darkness">deeper darkness</a>)
is ever exposed to light before the spell is cast, it looses its special properties
and becomes ordinary. But legen and folk tales are rife with examlpes of extra power
coming from ordinary items handled in a fanciful way. If you use such fanciful metamagic
components - which appear on table: Metamagic Components only rarely - keep a close
watch on how they change the economy of the game. If the PCs shy away from adventuring
in favor of working as metamagic-component coal miners, the situation is out of
hand.
<h6><a id="monster-parts"></a>Monster Parts</h6>
A few of the metamagic components listed on table: Metamagic Components are parts
of monsters. Some players want their characters to dissect their slain foes, "harvesting"
metamagic components for later use and sale.
<p>
There's a fair amount of real-world precedent for the notion that some part of a
creature's power remains in its body after it's dead. Dozens of real-world cultures
have rituals involving animal parts for this very reason. Fantasy literature has
a rich tradition of using strange ingredients such as unicorn horns and dragon scales
to accomplish great feats of magic.
</p>
<p>
But harvesting monster parts is not without it's problems. From a game balance standpoint,
saying a rakshasa hide is worth 1,250 gp is tantamount to giving every rakshasa
in the game world an extra 1,250 gp in treasure - yet it's treasure that the rakshasa
can't use itself (other than in the obvious way). It's also treasure that the PCs
can't aquire any way other than killing a rakshasa, as opposed to normal treasure,
which the PCs could obtain by tricking the rakshasa or driving it off. Requiring
the monster parts to be specially prepared ameliorates the problem to a degree -
and generally that's what we've done - because it's assumed that much of the cost
lies in the special preparation, not the on-site butchery. That pushes the problem
into a corner, but it doesn't eliminate it, because a player who has enough ranks in
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#profession">Profession</a> (taxidermy) skill may want to
know the DC for preparing the metamagic component himself. If monster part harvesting
becomes a frequent exercise in your game, carefully moniter the amount of other
treasure you give out. But extracting the teech of an accasional dragonne won't
break the game.
</p>
<p>
A second and thornier problem is that many players find harvesting monster parts
distasteful, and some players who don't mind the idea might play characters who
would be aghast at the very notion of cutting up the dead. Not only is the actual
harvesting objectionable to some, but it builds in a potential conflict between
characters who want to capture their foes (whether for mercy or imformation) and
those who want to slay them and begin dissection. Consider carefully the perspectives
of your players and their characters, and think hard about what kind of D&#38;D game
you want to run.
</p>
<p>
If your characters are interessted in doing some monster part harvesting themselves,
it takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#profession">Profession</a>
(taxidermy) check to carefully remove the relevant part, then 1 hour and a DC 20
Profession (taxidermy) check to preserve it so it won't rot or otherwise deteriorate.
The embalming materials themselves cost one-tenth of the market price of the finished
metamagic component. Unless you use <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsFtoG.html#gentle-repose">gentle repose</a>,
the monster's body deteriorates enough after 15 minutes that you can't get a metamagic
component from it.
</p>
<p>
With some monsters, it's obvious how many of a particular part they have - a beholder
has only one central eye that can be used for a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#greater-prying-eyes">greater prying eyes</a>
metamagic component. As a general rule, one monster provides enough substance for
a single casting of the relevant spell (such as the dire bat fur needed for
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#arcane-eye">arcane eye</a> or the chimera scales needed
for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#obscure-object">obscure object</a>). On some cases,
the number of parts that can be obtained from one creature is obvious by the nature
of the monster (one minotaur can supply enough metamagic components for two castings
of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#maze">maze</a>, and each of a gorgon's four hoves can
be used for a separate casting of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#acid-fog">acid fog</a>).
If the number of parts is not obvious or doesn't necessarily follow the general rule,
assume that one monster can provide up to 1d4 separate parts that are suitable for
metamagic components. (This guideline applies to such components as the janni eyelash
needed for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#invisibility">invisibility</a> and the troll
blood needed for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#regenerate">regenerate</a>.)

<h5><a id="house-rule-metamagic-and-sorcerers-i"></a>HOUSE RULE: METAMAGIC AND SORCERERS I</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">A sorcerer who wants to make better use of his metamagic feats, including the
possibility of using <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a> can
treat a metamagic version of a spell as a unique spell known. He must know any metamagic
feats he applies to the spell, and he must know the unmodified version of the spell.
For example, a 10the-level sorcerer who knows <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile">magic missile</a>
and the Quicken Spell feat can add "quickened magic missile" to his list of spells
known, counting as his one 5th-level spell.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px"><i>-James Wyatt</i></div>
<h5><a id="house-rule-metamagic-and-sorcerer-ii"></a>HOUSE RULE: METAMAGIC AND SORCERERS II</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">Som players in my game who run sorcerers feel they get short-changed by the rules
for metamagic feats. They don't like spending a full-round action to use the few
metamagic feats they know, and they especially don't like being no able to use the
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a> feat. I came up with a solution
that works for me.
<p>I allow sorcerers who know metamagic feats to "reserve" (essentially, prepare) spell
slots for use with metamagic feats they know. For example, a 10th-level sorcerer
can cast three 5th-level spells and five 4th-level spells per day (plus a buch of
lower-level spells). I let him mark any or all of those slots (or any others he has)
as reserved for use with particular metamagic feats. He might say that one of his
5th-level spells slots is a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spells</a>
slot and two of his 4th-level spells slots are reserved for <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#empower-spell">Empower Spell</a>.
I rule that it takes 15 minutes per spell slot for the sorcerer to reserve these slots.</p>
<p>The sorcerer, when he reserves the slots, does not have to specify the exact spells
that occupy them. He has, of course, designated the level of the spell: Only a 0-
or 1st-level spells can fill up the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a>
slot - it could be <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile">magic missile</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#mage-armor">mage armor</a>, or any other 1st-level spell
he knows. <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#empower-spell">Empower Spell</a> adds two levels
to a spells effective level, so empowered versions of 2nd-level spells occupy the
4th-level slots. If the sorcerer changes his mind later in the day, he can "unreserve"
the slots by taking 15 minutes of time per slot to do so. Otherwise, the slots remain
reserved until the sorcerer either casts spells using those slots or sleeps for
a night, resetting all his spell slots to normal.</p></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px"><i>-Ed Stark</i></div>
<h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-metamagic-components"></a>BEHIND THE CURTAIN: METAMAGIC COMPONENTS</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">If you use this variant,
you may find that characters are less likely to take metamagic feats because they
can just pay for the occasional metamagic effect by using a metamagic component
instead. Spellcasters who use metamagic components repeatedly may all behing the
other PCs in terms of wealth, because metamagic components are quite expensive.
Although using a metamagic component is more expensive than casting from a scroll
with the metamagic version of the spell, a spellcaster gets more bang for her buck
with a metamagic component, because she can use her own caster level and ability
score to set the spell's parameters such as save DC, damage, and range. Metamagic
components give spellcasters more flexibility, becuase they can either cast a spell
normally or get the extra benefit of the metamagic component, and they don't have
to decide until the moment spellcasting begins.
<p>Metamagic components are an effective tool for NPC spellcasters in particular,
who often have only a few rounds to cast spells before the encounter ends. But because
metamagic components are expensive, such NPCs may use up more of their treasure
than is typical.</p></div>
