<a id="monsters-as-races"></a><h2>Monsters as Races</h2>
<p class="initial">While every monster has the statistics that a
player would need to play the creature as a character, most monsters
are not suitable as PCs. Creatures who have an Intelligence score of 2
or lower, who have no way to communicate, or who are so different from
other PCs that they disrupt the campaign should not be used. Some
creatures have strange innate abilities or great physical power, and
thus are questionable at best as characters (except in high-level
campaigns). </p>
<a id="starting-level-of-a-monster-pc"></a><p><b>Starting Level of a Monster PC</b>: Monsters suitable for
play have a level adjustment given in their statistics. Add a monster&#8217;s
level adjustment to its Hit Dice and class levels to get the creature&#8217;s
effective character level, or ECL. Effectively, monsters with a level
adjustment become multiclass character when they take class levels. A
creature&#8217;s &#8220;monster class&#8221; is always a favored class, and the creature
never takes XP penalties for having it.</p>
<a id="humanoids-and-class-levels"></a><p><b>Humanoids and Class Levels</b>: Creatures with 1 or less HD
replace their monster levels with their character levels. The monster
loses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted
by its 1 monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills,
feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level character of the
appropriate class.</p>
<p>Characters with more than 1 Hit Die because of their race do
not get a feat for their first class level as members of the common
races do, and they do not multiply the skill points for their first
class level by four. Instead, they have already received a feat for
their first Hit Die because of race, and they have already multiplied
their racial skill points for their first Hit Die by four.</p>
<a id="level-adjustment-and-effective-character-level"></a><p><b>Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level</b>: To
determine the effective character level (ECL) of a monster character,
add its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class
levels. </p>
<p>Use ECL instead of character level to determine how many
experience points a monster character needs to reach its next level.
Also use ECL to determine starting wealth for a monster character.</p>
<p>Monster characters treat skills mentioned in their monster
entry as class skills. </p>
<p>If a monster has 1 Hit Die or less, or if it is a template
creature, it must start the game with one or more class levels, like a
regular character. If a monster has 2 or more Hit Dice, it can start
with no class levels (though it can gain them later).</p>
<p>Even if the creature is of a kind that normally advances by
Hit Dice rather than class levels a PC can gain class levels rather
than Hit Dice.</p>
<a id="hit-dice"></a><p><b>Hit Dice</b>: The creature&#8217;s Hit Dice equal the number of
class levels it has plus its racial Hit Dice. Additional Hit Dice
gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a
creature&#8217;s size like additional racial Hit Dice do.</p>
<a id="feat-aquisition-and-ability-score-increases"></a><p><b>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases</b>: A
monster&#8217;s total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its acquisition of feats
and ability score increases. </p>
<a id="ability-scores-for-monster-pcs"></a><p><b>Ability Scores for Monster PCs</b>: While a monsters
statistics give the ability scores for a typical creature of a certain
kind, any &#8220;monster&#8221; creature that becomes an adventurer is definitely
not typical. Therefore, when creating a PC from a creature, check to
see if the creature&#8217;s entry has any ability scores of 10 or higher. If
so, for each score, subtract 10 (if the score is even) or 11 (if the
score is odd) to get the creature&#8217;s modifier for that ability based on
its race or kind. Generate the character&#8217;s ability scores as normal,
then add the racial ability modifiers to get their ability scores. </p>
<p><i>Note</i>: Some monsters have base ability scores other than
10 and 11. If alternate scores were used this will be indicated in the
monster entry. Also, some monsters that make good PCs have their racial
ability modifiers and other traits already listed in their monster
entry.</p>
<p>For ability scores lower than 10, the procedure is different.
First, determine the character&#8217;s ability scores, and compare that
number to the monster&#8217;s average ability score, using either the table
below that applies to Intelligence or the table that applies to the
other five ability scores. </p>
<p>The separate table for Intelligence ensures that no PC ends up
with an Intelligence score lower than 3. This is important, because
creatures with an Intelligence score lower than 3 are not playable
characters. Creatures with any ability score lower than 1 are also not
playable.</p>
