Incantations are like spells, but they can be cast by characters who are
not spellcasters. This variant enables characters who know the correct
ritual gestures and phrases for an incantation to achieve powerful magic
effects. Incantations don�t use spell slots, you don�t have to prepare
them ahead of time, and you can use an incantation an unlimited number of
times per day.
<p>
Incantations have drawbacks: They�re time-consuming to cast, and success
isn�t assured. They are often expensive, and some require additional
participants to complete the ritual. Some incantations work only under
certain specific conditions, such as during a full moon.
</p>
<p>
Most important among the drawbacks, an incantation rarely fades away
quietly if the caster fails to perform the ritual correctly. Instead it
reverses itself on the caster, explodes with a cascade of magical energy,
or weakens the barrier between worlds, enabling hostile outsiders to
emerge onto the Material Plane.
</p>
<p>
This variant gives a measure of magical power to nonspellcasters, but the
incantations themselves are usually too specific in effect to increase a
character�s power in the general sense. Because many incantations require
academic skills such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a>, the characters best equipped to cast
them are often spellcasters anyway.
</p>
<p>
Incantations provide a useful way to introduce powerful magical effects in
a lower-level game under controlled conditions. PCs will still use spells
rather than expensive, risky incantations whenever they can. Incantations
are also more specific than spells, so the GM can introduce them into the
game without worrying that they�ll spread beyond the immediate situation.
</p>
<p>
If you want characters in your low-level game to take a brief sojourn to
an Outer plane, you can introduce the incantation <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#hrothgars-journey">Hrothgar�s journey</a>. Because it
requires the construction of a thatched hut in the middle of a forest and
works only during the winter solstice, you don�t have to worry about the
characters exploring the Outer Planes whenever they get the urge. If you
gave low-level PCs easy access to the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#plane-shift">plane shift</a> spell, on the other
hand, they could wander the planes until they ran afoul of the first
outsider more powerful than they are (which is almost any outsider).
</p>
<h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-creating-incantations"></a>
BEHIND THE CURTAIN: CREATING INCANTATIONS
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">It�s important to realize that this system for creating incantations is
meant as a starting point, not the last word. Anytime you apply multiple
modifiers to a single DC, the potential for accidental consequences or
intentional abuse is there.
<p>
To keep incantations under control in your campaign, avoid creating
incantations with skill
check DCs lower than 20. Furthermore, you should emphasize how much
faster, easier, and safer spells are than incantations. Every incantation
you create should have at least one component that�s difficult for the
caster to deal with, such as an XP cost, an expensive material component,
or a significant backlash component. Because incantations don�t require
spell slots � or even spellcasting ability � you need to make sure that
characters can�t simply cast incantations repeatedly, stopping only to
sleep.
</p>
<p>
Incantations are most effective when they�re specific; they should always
be more narrowly focused than spells that accomplish similar tasks. The
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#planar-binding">planar binding</a> spell, for example, can trap and compel service from any
elemental or outsider with 12 HD or less. A comparable incantation,
Xecilgarasp among the bones, would call one specific <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersDtoDe.html#bebilith-demon">bebilith</a> named
Xecilgarasp for a specific job: guarding a tomb. If ordered to do anything
else, Xecilgarasp attacks the caster instead. And if Xecilgarasp ever dies
while guarding a tomb, the incantation is thereafter useless. The
Xecilgarasp among the bones incantation is just as powerful as the planar
binding spell in the specific instance it was designed for, but it has
limited or no utility beyond that.
</p></div>
<h5><a id="discovering-incantations"></a>
Discovering Incantations
</h5>
Obscure tomes and spellbooks filled with mystical ramblings, descriptions
of magic theory, ordinary arcane spells, and utterly useless or
incomprehensible magical writing often hide the instructions for
performing incantations. In those dusty volumes, diligent readers can find
incantations with real power � magical recipes that provide step-by-step
instructions for achieving a powerful effect.
<p>
If the characters have access to a well-stocked library of magical
information, finding a set of instructions for a particular incantation
requires a successful <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) check with a DC 10 lower than the
DC for casting the incantation. Just being aware of the existence of a
particular incantation requires a Knowledge (arcana) check with a DC 15
lower than the incantation�s casting DC.
</p>
<h5><a id="casting-an-incantation"></a>
CASTING AN INCANTATION
</h5>
At its simplest, casting an incantation is akin to preparing and cooking
something according to a recipe. You must have the ingredients in hand,
then use your skill in cooking to perform each step in order. In game
terms, this means having the required incantation components, then
succeeding on a number of skill checks � often <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a>
(arcana) checks � during the incantation�s casting time.
<p>
Each incantation description tells how many successful skill checks are required to
cast the incantation. Unless otherwise specified, the caster makes a skill
check every 10 minutes. If checks involving more than one skill are
required, the checks may be made in any order, as desired by the caster.
Failing one skill check means that 10 minutes have gone by, and the
incantation is in danger of failing. If two skill checks in a row are
failed, the incantation fails. Each incantation has a consequence
associated with failure. Even if the incantation fails, the casting still
consumes all the components (including expensive material components and
experience points).
</p>
<p>
Because of the unusual outcomes possible on a failure, the GM may choose
to make these skill
checks in secret. Doing this prevents the player of the caster from
knowing whether an incantation has succeeded or failed. If the consequence
of failure is immediate and severe (such as death resulting from a failed
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="#fires-of-dis">fires of Dis</a> incantation), the effect is obvious, and concealing it serves
no purpose.
</p>
<p>
Many incantations have a backlash component, which is an ill effect
suffered by the caster at the conclusion of the casting or upon failure of
the incantation (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#backlash">Backlash</a>, below).
</p>
<h6><a id="saves-and-spell-resistance"></a>
Saves and Spell Resistance
</h6>
If an incantation allows a save, the formula to calculate the save is
included in the incantation�s description. For checks to overcome spell
resistance, divide the incantation�s skill check DC by 2 to get
the effective caster level for the spell resistance check. For example,
the caster of a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#fires-of-dis">fires of Dis</a> incantation (DC 23) would add +11 to a d20
roll when attempting to overcome the spell resistance of the target.
<h6><a id="interrupting-incantations"></a>
Interrupting Incantations
</h6>
Incantations take a long time to cast, but they aren�t as delicate and
exacting as traditional spells. Casting an incantation does not provoke an
attack of opportunity, and a caster can even pause the ritual for a short
time in order to fight, cast a spell, or take some other action. For each
round the incantation is interrupted, the DC of all subsequent skill checks to complete the
casting increases by 1. Time spent during the interruption of an
incantation does not count toward the incantation�s casting time.
<h6><a id="taking-10"></a>
Taking 10
</h6>
As long as the caster of an incantation is not threatened or distracted,
he may take 10. Incantations with backlash components or similarly harmful
aspects count as threats that prevent the caster from taking 10. A caster
may never take 20 when attempting to complete an incantation.
<h5><a id="incantation-components"></a>
INCANTATION COMPONENTS
</h5>
Most incantations require components not unlike those of spells, including
verbal, somatic, focus, and material components. In addition, some require
secondary casters (abbreviated SC in the Components line of a
description), or cause some sort of backlash (abbreviated B), or cost the
caster some amount of experience points (abbreviated XP).
<h6><a id="secondary-casters"></a>
Secondary Casters
</h6>
Some incantations require multiple participants to have any hope of
succeeding. These secondary casters are indispensable to the success of
the incantation. However, no matter how many people are gathered in the
dark room, chanting with candles, only one character � most commonly the one
with the highest modifier in the relevant skill � is the primary caster who
makes the relevant checks. Secondary casters can�t help the primary caster
succeed by means of the aid another action, but their presence is required
for certain aspects of the ritual nonetheless.
<p>
Often, an incantation is hosted with more than the minimum number of
casters. If the primary caster or a secondary caster is killed or
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#disabled">disabled</a>, one of these bystanders can step into a role.
</p>
<p>
If an incantation requires a check involving a skill other than <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a>
(arcana), any secondary caster can make that check if he or she has a
higher skill modifier than the primary caster. Casters who favor the
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="#hrothgars-journey">Hrothgar�s journey</a> incantation, for example, keep bards on hand if they
aren�t highly skilled in <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> (oratory) themselves.
</p>
<h6><a id="backlash"></a>
Backlash
</h6>
Some incantations damage or drain the caster in some way when they are
cast. They have a backlash component: damage, negative levels, or some
other effect. The caster experiences the backlash effect regardless of the
success or failure of the incantation.
<h5><a id="failed-incantations"></a>
FAILED INCANTATIONS
</h5>
When two skill
checks in a row result in failure (whether or not they�re made by the
same character), the incantation as a whole fails. The character who
failed the second check experiences the effect indicated in the
incantation�s description. In general, the consequences of failure can be
divided into the following categories. (Many of these effects are not
mentioned in the sample incantations that follow; they are provided here
for use in incantations that could be developed for a campaign.)
<p><b><a id="attack"></a>Attack:</b>
A creature is called from elsewhere to battle the caster (and often any
bystanders and secondary casters). The incantation�s description tells the
GM what Challenge Rating the creature should have, how it behaves, and how
long it persists.
</p>
<p><b><a id="augment"></a>Augment:</b>
The incantation was supposed to weaken or destroy its target, but it makes
the target more powerful instead. An incantation that deals damage might
heal its target or cause it to grow in power, for example.
</p>
<p><b><a id="betrayal"></a>Betrayal:</b>
The incantation seemingly succeeds, but the subject of the incantation
(or, in rare cases, the caster) undergoes a dramatic alignment change. Over the next 1d6
minutes, the subject�s alignment becomes the extreme opposite of what it
was previously (for instance, lawful good becomes chaotic evil, or chaotic
neutral becomes lawful neutral; a neutral subject randomly becomes lawful
good, lawful evil, chaotic good, or chaotic evil). The subject generally
tries to keep its new outlook a secret.
</p>
<p><b><a id="damage"></a>Damage:</b>
Either the caster or the target takes damage as the consequence of
failure.
</p>
<p><b><a id="death"></a>Death:</b>
Someone � usually the caster or the target � dies. Some incantations allow a
saving throwto avoid this consequence of failure.
</p>
<p><b><a id="delusion"></a>Delusion:</b>
The caster believes the incantation had the desired effect, but in fact it
had no effect or a very different one.
</p>
<p><b><a id="falsehood"></a>Falsehood:</b>
The incantation (typically a divination) delivers false results to the
caster, but the caster believes the results are true.
</p>
<p><b><a id="hostile-spell"></a>Hostile Spell:</b>
The caster of the incantation is targeted by a harmful spell. The
incantation description gives the specific spell, save DC, and other
particulars.
</p>
<p><b><a id="mirrorcast"></a>Mirrorcast:</b>
The incantastion has the opposite effect of what was intended.
</p>
<p><b><a id="reversal"></a>Reversal:</b>
The incantation affects the caster rather than the intended target.
</p>
<h5><a id="sample-incantations"></a>
SAMPLE INCANTATIONS
</h5>
The following incantations are among the better-known incantations in
existence � which means that no more than a few eldritch scholars know about
them. Characters can learn of their existence during the course of an
adventure by making a <a href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) check (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#discovering-incantations">Discovering
Incantations</a>, above).
<h6><a id="call-forth-the-dweller"></a>
Call Forth the Dweller
</h6>
Divination
<b>Effective Level:</b> 6th
<b>Skill Check:</b> <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) DC 20, 6 successes
<b>Failure:</b> Falsehood
<b>Components:</b> V, S, M, F, XP, B
<b>Casting Time:</b> 60 minutes
<b>Range:</b> Personal
<b>Target:</b> You
<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous
<b>Saving Throw:</b> None
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> No
<p>
This incantation contacts the enigmatic, extradimensional being known as
the Dweller on the Threshold, an entity that imparts knowledge about its
specific obsession: doors and other entrances.
</p>
<p>
To cast call forth the Dweller, the caster must inscribe forty-two mystic
symbols around an open doorway, then begin the chants and supplications
required for the incantation.
</p>
<p>
If the incantation succeeds, an image of the Dweller � an inky mass of
tentacles and mouths � appears on the other side of the doorway. The Dweller
on the Threshold truthfully answers any questions it is asked about a
particular door. For example, the Dweller can provide a magical password
that unlocks a door, indicate how to disarm a trap on a door, reveal the
weaknesses of a door�s guardian, or describe the room that lies beyond the
door. Its answers are clear and fairly specific, if somewhat terse. The
caster may well appreciate such concise answers, because one of the
forty-two symbols inscribed around the doorway during the casting of the
incantation fades away with each word the Dweller on the Threshold
speaks � and when all the symbols are gone, the Dweller disappears.
</p>
<p>
If the caster asks the Dweller on the Threshold a question that doesn�t
involve doors, the Dweller responds with a cutting insult, often about
something the caster thought was secret. Each word of the insult likewise
makes a symbol disappear from the perimeter of the doorway.
</p>
<p>
The exact nature of the Dweller on the Threshold is shrouded in mystery.
Some contend that it is somehow connected to the god of secrets, although
no one has ever found conclusive evidence that the Dweller on the
Threshold is evil.
</p>
<p><b>Option:</b>
If the doorway used as the focus is one that the Dweller has been asked
about in the past, the caster gains a +4 bonus on the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana)
checks during the incantation. For example, if Boredflak uses call forth
the Dweller to learn about the Gateway to Despair, then when he reaches
the Gateway, he can use the Gateway as the focus and gain a +4 bonus when
he uses the incantation to ask about the Arches of Certain Doom.
</p>
<p><i>Failure:</i>
If the caster fails two consecutive Knowledge (arcana) checks, the Dweller
on the Threshold gleefully lies, employing falsehoods that demonstrate its
inclination toward mischief and cruelty.
</p>
<p><i>Material Component:</i>
Forty-two mystic symbols inscribed around the perimeter of the focus
doorway (requiring materials costing 500 gp). As described above, these
symbols gradually disappear during the time the incantation is in effect.
</p>
<p><i>Focus:</i>
An open doorway large enough to allow a Medium creature to pass through
it.
</p>
<p><i>XP Component:</i>
400 XP.
</p>
<p><i>Backlash:</i>
After speaking with the Dweller on the Threshold, the caster is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#exhausted">exhausted</a>.
</p>
<p><i>Campaign Use:</i>
This incantation is an obvious solution for characters who are "stuck"� by
an especially impenetrable door. The exhaustion backlash makes it less
likely they immediately try the door after casting the incantation, and
the XP cost ensures that they won�t try to use call forth the Dweller on
every door they face. If you introduce this incantation in your game,
you�re giving the PCs occasional access to a powerful divination. But
because it�s rather specific, it doesn�t make the characters more
powerful. Typically, getting through a door lands PCs in trouble more
quickly than if they were unable to pass the portal.

<b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half (DC 19 + caster's Cha modifier)
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes
<p>
This incantation, dreamed up by insane cultists, opens a fell rift between
the Material Plane and Dis, the fiery second layer of the Nine Hells. This
rift brings about a massive conflagration that destroys almost everything
in the immediate area, then releases a powerful devil who capers over the
smoldering ruins and begins to rampage across the countryside. The fires
of Dis ignite everything they touch � except for the caster, who is
transported to Dis as the result of the incantation�s backlash.
</p>
<p>
When the incantation is complete, the fires of Dis fill an 80-foot-radius
spread around the caster�s former location, dealing 18d6 points of fire
damage (Reflex half) to all creatures and objects. Additionally,
everything flammable in that radius is now on fire (as described in
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="wildernessAndEnvironment.html#catching-on-fire">Catching on Fire</a>).
</p>
<p>
In the following round, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersDtoDe.html#pit-fiend-devil">pit fiend</a> comes through the rift, which then
closes. The creature begins to destroy everything in sight.
</p>
<p><i>Failure:</i>
Death of the character who failed the second consecutive skill check.
</p>
<p><i>Material Component:</i>
Rare unguents and dark alchemical concoctions worth 5,000 gp.
</p>
<p><i>XP Component:</i>
1,000 XP.
</p>
<p><i>Backlash:</i>
The caster is knocked <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a> and transported to Dis (no save).
</p>
<p><i>Extra Casters:</i>
Six required; they chant choruses and supplications to various dark
deities throughout the incantation.
</p>
<p><i>Campaign Use:</i>
Obviously, the backlash component is significant enough that most PCs will
not seriously consider casting this incantation. But even a low- to
mid-level character has a decent chance of making all the skill checks without failing
twice in a row, so the incantation could show up in a campaign in a number
of different circumstances. For instance, the PCs may be tipped off that
suicidal cultists are trying to bring the fires of Dis to their city, and
they have to disrupt the incantation. The fires of Dis might also have a
place in a mystery adventure, where the PCs must discover who stole rare
alchemical compounds. A routine investigation takes on new urgency when
the PCs find out that the missing vials can be the material component for
a fires of Dis incantation.

Hrothgar�s Journey
</h6>
Conjuration (Teleportation)
<b>Effective Level:</b> 6th
<b>Skill Check:</b> <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) DC 20, 2 successes; <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> (oratory) DC 20, 4 successes

<b>Components:</b> V, S, M, SC, B
<b>Casting Time:</b> 60 minutes
<b>Range:</b> Touch
<b>Target or Targets:</b> Caster plus four to twelve other creatures
<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous
<b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless) (DC 16 + caster's Cha modifier)
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)
<p>
Hrothgar�s journey is an incantation based on the tale of Hrothgar, a
powerful barbarian hero from ages past. When the poetic epic of Hrothgar
is recited in the stifling heat of a sweat lodge during the winter
solstice, the orator and his listeners receive the same final reward that
Hrothgar did: a one-way trip to a mythic outer plane, where they can
drink and make merry with the greatest warriors of myth.
</p>
<p>
To cast the incantation, the caster must construct a small, windowless hut
in the middle of the forest, then build a bonfire in the hut�s center. At
least four and up to twelve others accompany the caster into the hut. Then
the flames are lit and the telling of the tale of Hrothgar begins.
</p>
<p>
Because the bonfire is large and the hut is small, the atmosphere inside
quickly gets stiflingly hot. This is the incantation�s backlash; unlike
most backlash components, it affects the incantation�s other targets as
well as the caster. Any creature inside the hut must make a Fortitude save every 10
minutes or suffer the effects of severe heat (as described in <a style="color: #579eb6" href="wildernessAndEnvironment.html#heat-dangers">Heat Dangers</a>).
</p>
<p>
Just as the tale of Hrothgar approaches its conclusion (near the end of
the casting time), the bonfire�s flames light the hut on fire, which
creates a great deal of smoke but no additional heat or damage. If the
final skill check
succeeds, the flames consume the hut�s roof and walls, revealing the mythic plain og legend.
</p>
<p><i>Material Component:</i>
A windowless, thatched hut in a forest.
</p>
<p><i>Backlash Component:</i>
Severe heat.
</p>
<p><i>Extra Casters:</i>
Four required; they provide the dialogue for other characters in the epic
of Hrothgar.
</p>
<p><i>Campaign Use:</i>
Hrothgar�s journey is well within the reach of mid-level PCs, especially
bards. Of all the Outer Planes, this chaotic neutral/chaotic good plane is perhaps the most hospitable to
PCs and the easiest to work into an ongoing campaign, so the incantation
may be a good way to whet the players� appetite for planar travel without
opening up the entire cosmology. In the hands of NPCs, Hrothgar�s journey
can be an escape route for the barbarian raiders the characters have been
chasing for months. Or a mischievous NPC bard can beckon the PCs into a
warm hut on a cold winter�s night, promising them a wondrous reward if
they just listen to a tale�
</p>
<h5><a id="crating-new-incantations"></a>
CREATING NEW INCANTATIONS
</h5>
Making unique incantations for your campaign is a tricky balancing act.
Incantations are intentionally constructed to be much more idiosyncratic
than spells are. And because incantations hinge on skill checks, it�s possible
for a character to get access to powerful magic before he � or the
campaign � is ready for it. The following guidelines will help you balance
the benefit of an incantation with its negative aspects, and also
determine how difficult the incantation is to cast.
<ol>
<li>
<b><a id="determine-school"></a>Determine School:</b>
When you design an incantation, first decide which school or schools
the incantation would fit into if it were a spell. Each school has a
specific DC, which serves as the base skill check DC for the
incantation you�re designing. Consult the descriptions of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="magicSchools.html">schools of
magic</a> if you aren�t sure which school an incantation should belong
to. If you�re designing an incantation that could qualify for more
than one school, choose the most important one to provide the base DC.
Other schools add one-third their DC to the total. For example, the
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="#fires-of-dis">fires of Dis</a> incantation has conjuration as its most important school
(because of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersDtoDe.html#pit-fiend-devil">pit fiend</a> it calls) and evocation as a second school
(because of the fiery burst it creates). Thus, the fires of Dis
incantation has a base DC of 41 (30 + 11) for all skill checks made
during its casting.
<p>
Each summary below specifies the range, target, duration, and other
aspects of an incantation associated with a particular school.
</p>
<p><i>Abjuration:</i>
DC 32; Range: Close; Target: One or more creatures, no two of which
can be more than 30 ft. apart; Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw: Will
negates; Spell Resistance: Yes.
</p>
<p><i>Conjuration:</i>
DC 30; Range: Close; Target: One creature; Duration: Hours
(Instantaneous for teleportation subschool); Saving Throw: Will
negates (harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless).
</p>
<p><i>Divination:</i>
DC 30; Range: Long; Target: Personal; Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw:
None; Spell Resistance: No.
</p>
<p><i>Enchantment:</i>
DC 32; Range: Close; Target: One living creature; Duration: Minutes;
Saving Throw: Will negates; Spell Resistance: Yes.
</p>
<p><i>Evocation:</i>
DC 34; Range: Medium; Area: 5-ft.-wide bolt or 20-ft.-radius burst;
Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw:
Reflex half; Spell Resistance: Yes.
</p>
<p><i>Illusion:</i>
DC 32; Range: Touch; Target: One living creature or 20 cu. ft. of
matter; Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw: Will
disbelief; Spell Resistance: No.
</p>
<p><i>Necromancy:</i>
DC 34; Range: Close; Target: One or more creatures or corpses;
Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw:

</p>
<p><i>Transmutation:</i>
DC 32; Range: Medium; Target: One creature or 20 cu. ft. of matter;
Duration: Rounds; Saving Throw:
Fortitude half (often harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b><a id="modify-dc"></a>Modify DC:</b>
Next, determine modifications to the base DC based on the specifics of
your ritual; see the table below for a list of general factors and how
they change the skill check DC.
Increasing the base range of an incantation, for example, is a factor
that increases the DC. Reducing the duration of an incantation, on the
other hand, is a factor that reduces the DC.
</li>
<li>
<b><a id="set-level"></a>Set Level:</b>
Finally, set the effective level of the incantation. Incantations are
like 6th- through 9th-level spells, so you can set the effective level
of the incantation by comparing what the incantation does to what
spells of that level can accomplish. The effective level determines a
number of aspects of the incantation: how many total successes are
required, the exact save DC of the incantation, and sometimes the
incantation�s precise range and duration.
<p><i>Total Successes:</i>
Equal to the incantation�s effective level.
</p>
<p><i>Save DC:</i>
10 + incantation�s effective level + caster�s Cha modifier.
</p>
<p><i>Duration and Range</i>
Assume a caster level of twice the incantation�s level, using the same
formula a spell would. For example, an incantation with a duration of
"minutes" would last 12 minutes if it�s effectively a 6th-level spell.
The same incantation with a range of medium can affect a target up to
220 feet away.
