<a id="using-items"></a><h5>USING ITEMS</h5>
To use a psionic item, it must be activated, although sometimes
activation is accomplished simply by picking up an item or putting it
on. Some items, once they are carried or worn, function constantly. In
most cases, using an item requires a standard action that does not
provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, power completion items
(see below) are treated just like powers in combat and do provoke
attacks of opportunity.
<p>Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item
description indicates otherwise. The manifesting time of a power is the
time required to activate the same power in an item, whether it&#8217;s a
power stone, a dorje, or a psionic tattoo, unless the item description
specifically states otherwise.</p>
<p>The four ways to activate psionic items are described below.</p>
<a id="power-completion"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Completion:</span> This
is the activation method for power stones. A power stone holds a power
that is mostly finished. All that&#8217;s left to do is perform the short,
simple, finishing parts of the manifestation (the final mental coda, as
it were). To use a power completion item safely, a character must be of
high enough level in the appropriate class to manifest the power
already. If he can&#8217;t already manifest the power, there&#8217;s a chance he&#8217;ll
make a mistake (see Brainburn in the power stone description).
Activating a power completion item is a standard action and provokes
attacks of opportunity exactly as manifesting a power does.</p>
<p>Powers stored in power completion items are usually not
augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to
be the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an
item&#8217;s description may specify otherwise (some power stones have
manifester levels higher than the minimum required to manifest the
stored power, and are then assumed to be augmented as well).</p>
<a id="power-trigger"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Trigger:</span> This is
the activation method for dorjes and psicrowns. It requires the special
knowledge of power manifestation that a character of the appropriate
class would know, and the formation of the appropriate command thought.
If a power is on a character&#8217;s power list, the character knows how to
use a power trigger item that stores that power. The user must still
determine what power is stored in the item before she can activate it.
Activating a power trigger item is a standard action that does not
provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Powers stored in power trigger items are not augmented. Such
powers are assumed to be stored in the item at the minimum manifester
level necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may
specify a higher manifester level than necessary. If such an item holds
a power that deals hit point damage, the power is assumed to be
augmented to the maximum allowed by the power and the manifester level.</p>
<a id="command-thought"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Thought:</span> If no
activation method is suggested either in the psionic item description
or by the nature of the item, assume that a command thought is needed
to activate it. Command thought activation means that a character
mentally projects a thought, and the item activates. No other special
knowledge is needed. Activating a command thought psionic item is a
standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. </p>
<p>Sometimes the command thought to activate an item is mentally
imprinted within it and is whispered into the mind of a creature who
picks it up. Other items are silent, but a <a
href="psionicSkills.html#knowledge-psionics"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Knowledge (psionics)</a> or <a
href="skillsAll.html#knowledge" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Knowledge</a>
(history) check might
be useful in helping to identify
command thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with
the command thought in this case. The power psionic identify reveals
command thoughts.</p>
<p>Powers stored in command thought items are usually not
augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to
be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.</p>
<a id="use-activated"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use-Activated:</span> This
type of psionic item simply has to be used to activate. Use activation
is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears.
Some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this
activation sometimes requires a command thought (see above), usually it
means mentally willing the activation to happen&nbsp; (a free action).
The description of an item states whether a command thought is needed
in such a case.</p>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic
item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not
provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an
action that provokes attacks of opportunity in itself. If the use of
the item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use activation
is a standard action. If the item&#8217;s activation is subsumed in its use
and takes no extra time, use activation is not an action at all.</p>
<p>Use activation doesn&#8217;t mean that if you use an item, you
automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess)
what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the
benefit of the item comes automatically.</p>
<p>Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not
augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to
be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.</p>
<a id="saving-throws-against-psionic-item-powers"></a><h5>SAVING THROWS AGAINST PSIONIC ITEM POWERS</h5>
Psionic items produce psionic powers. The DC of a saving throw against
a power from a psionic item is always 10 + the level of the power or
effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to
manifest that level of power.
<p>Another way to figure the same number is to multiply the
power&#8217;s level by 1-1/2 and add 10 to the result.</p>
<p>Psicrowns are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw
as if the wielder manifested the power, including manifester level and
all
modifiers to save DC.</p>
<p>Some psionic items take advantage of the fact that powers can
be augmented to increase their saving throw DCs. These items are
special and have their cost to create and market price calculated using
the manifester&#8217;s level instead of the power&#8217;s level.</p>
<p>Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various
effects, particularly when the effect has no exact power equivalent
(making its level otherwise difficult to quickly determine).</p>
<a id="damaging-psionics-items"></a><h5>DAMAGING PSIONIC ITEMS</h5>
A psionic item doesn&#8217;t need to make a saving throw unless it is
unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder
rolls a natural 1 on his saving throw. Psionic items should always get
a save against powers or spells that might deal damage to them - even
against attacks from which a mundane item would normally get no chance
to save. All types of psionic item saves - Fortitude, Reflex, and
Will - are calculated the same way: The item&#8217;s saving throw bonus
equals
2 + 1/2 its manifester level (round down). The only exceptions to this
rule are intelligent psionic items, which make Will saves based on
their own Wisdom scores.
<p>A psionic item, unless otherwise noted, takes damage as a
normal item of the same type. A damaged psionic item continues to
function, but if it is destroyed, all its psionic power is lost.</p>
<a id="reparing-items"></a><h5>REPAIRING ITEMS</h5>
Some psionic items (especially psionic weapons and shields) may take
damage over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a
psionic item with the <a href="skillsAll.html#craft"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Craft</a> skill than it does to
repair its nonpsionic
counterpart. The <a href="spellsMtoO.html#make-whole"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">make whole</a> spell can repair a
damaged - but not
completely broken - psionic item.
<a id="intelligent-items"></a><h5>INTELLIGENT ITEMS</h5>
Some psionic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all
their own. Only permanent psionic items (as opposed to those that are
single-use items, those that have charges, or those that store power
points) can be intelligent. (This means that psionic tattoos, power
stones, and dorjes, among other items, are never intelligent.) In
general, less than 1% of psionic items have intelligence.
<a id="cursed-items"></a><h5>CURSED ITEMS</h5>
Some psionic items are cursed - incorrectly made, or corrupted by
outside
forces. Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or
they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient
requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are
cursed 5% of the time.
<a id="charges-and-multiple-uses"></a><h5>CHARGES AND MULTIPLE USES</h5>
Some items are limited in power by the number of charges they hold or
the number of power points they contain. Normally, charged items (such
as dorjes) have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a
random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the
number of charges left (round down, minimum 1).
<p>Similarly, items that contain power points (such as psicrowns)
have a number of points equal to 50 x the manifester level of the
creator. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll
d% and divide by 2 to determine the number by which the manifester
level is multiplied (round down, minimum 1).</p>
<p>Market prices given on the tables are always for fully charged
or fully powered items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged
or fully powered.) For an item that&#8217;s worthless when its charges or
power points run out (which is the case for almost all charged or
powered items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to
the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition
to its charges, only part of the item&#8217;s value is based on the number of
charges left.</p>
<p>Some items are single-use and expendable. Such items can often
be found in sets or groups.</p>

</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%">

</tbody>
</table>
In the following sections, each type of psionic item, such as armor or
psionic tattoos, has a general description, followed by descriptions of
specific items.
<p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random
generation, and other information. The Armor Class, hardness, hit
points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some types of
psionic items. The Armor Class assumes that the item is unattended and
includes a -5 penalty for the item&#8217;s effective Dexterity of 0. If a
creature holds the item, use the creature&#8217;s Dexterity modifier as an
adjustment to Armor Class in place of the -5 penalty.</p>
<p>Some individual items, notably those that simply store psionic
powers, don&#8217;t get full-blown descriptions. Simply reference the power&#8217;s
description. Assume that the power is manifested at the minimum level
required to manifest it, unless otherwise noted. Increasing the
manifester level so increases the cost of the item; see <a
href="magicItemsCreation.html#table-estimating-values"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Table:
Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values</a>, substituting &#8220;spell&#8221; for
&#8220;power&#8221; and &#8220;caster level&#8221; for &#8220;manifester level&#8221; as appropriate. The
main reason to make the manifester level higher, or course, would be to
increase the potency of the power. Raising the manifester level is
common for powers such as <a
href="psionicPowersAtoC.html#astral-construct"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">astral construct</a>, the duration
of which
increases with the level of the manifester.</p>
<p>Items with full descriptions have their abilities detailed,
and each of the following aspects of these items is summarized at the
end of the description.</p>
<a id="aura"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aura:</span> Most of the
time, a <a href="psionicPowersDtoF.html#detect-psionics"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">detect psionics</a> power will
reveal the discipline associated
with a psionic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This
information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item&#8217;s
notational entry in the form of a phrase. See the detect psionics power
description for more information.</p>
<a id="manifester-level"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifester Level:</span> The
next entry in the summary indicates the level of the creator (or the
manifester level of the powers placed within the item, if this level is
lower than the actual level of the creator). The manifester level
provides the item&#8217;s saving throw bonus, as well as range and other
level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).</p>
<p>It also determines the level that must be contended with
should the item come under the effect of a <a
href="psionicPowersDtoF.html#dispel-psionics"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dispel psionics</a> power or a
similar situation. This information is given in the form &#8220;<span
style="font-style: italic;">ML</span> x,&#8221; where
&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">ML</span>&#8221; is an abbreviation for
manifester level and &#8220;x&#8221; is an ordinal number representing the
manifester
level itself.</p>
<p>For psionic tattoos, power stones, and dorjes, the creator can
set the manifester level of an item at any number high enough to
manifest the stored power and not higher than her own manifester level.
For other psionic items,the manifester level is determined by the creator. The minimum manifester level
is that which is needed to meet the prerequisites given.</p>
<a id="prerequisites"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> Certain
requirements must be met in order for a character to create a psionic
item. These include feats, powers, and miscellaneous requirements such
as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation
of an item are given in the summary immediately following the item&#8217;s
manifester level.</p>
<p>A power prerequisite can be provided by a character who knows
the power, or through the use of a power completion or power trigger
psionic item or a psi-like ability that produces the desired power
effect. For each day that passes during the creation process, the
creator must expend one power completion item (such as a power stone)
or 1 charge from a power trigger item (such as a dorje), if either of
those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.</p>
<p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the
creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the
prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary, such
as if one character knows some of the powers necessary to create an
item and another character knows the rest.</p>
<p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they
must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the
purpose of determinations where the creator&#8217;s level must be known.
(It&#8217;s sensible, although not mandatory, for the highest-level character
involved to be considered the creator.) The character designated as the
creator pays the experience points required to make the item.</p>
<p>Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one
or more powers (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).
When two powers at the end of a list are separated by &#8220;or,&#8221; one of
those powers is required in addition to every other power mentioned
prior to the last two.</p>
<a id="market-price"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Market Price:</span> This
gold piece value, given in the summary following the word &#8220;<span
style="font-style: italic;">Price</span>,&#8221;
represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item.
Market prices are also included on the random generation tables for
easy reference. The market price of an item that can be constructed
with a psionic item creation feat is usually equal to the base price +
the price for any components (special materials or experience point
expenditure).</p>
<a id="cost-to-create"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost to Create:</span> The
cost in gold pieces and experience points to create the item is given
in the summary following the word &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Cost</span>.&#8221;
This information appears only
for items with components (material or experience points) that make
their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create
includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the cost of the
components. Items without components do not have a &#8220;Cost&#8221; entry. For
them, the market price and base price are the same. The cost in gold
pieces is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in experience points is
1/25 the market price. </p>
<a id="weight"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weight:</span> The notational
entry for many items ends with a value for the item&#8217;s weight. When a
weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for
the purpose of determining how much of a load a character can carry).</p>

</p>
<a id="creating-dorjes"></a><h6>Creating Dorjes</h6>
To create a dorje, a character needs a small supply of materials, the
most obvious being a chunk of crystal or the crystal shards of the
dorje to be carved from or assembled. The cost of the materials is
subsumed in the cost of creating the dorje:
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">375 gp x the level of the
power x the level of the manifester</span>. </p>
</div>
<p>Dorjes are always fully charged
(50 charges) when created. </p>
<p>If an augmentable power is incorporated into a dorje at a
higher manifester level than the minimum level required to manifest the
power, each discharge of the power from the dorje is augmented to the
limit of that higher manifester level. Alternatively, if you want to
have a higher manifester level in the dorje, you must pay for the dorje
as if the power was one level higher for each additional two manifester
levels you want. </p>
<p>The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in
the dorje (or must have the power available in some other form). If
manifesting the power would reduce the manifester&#8217;s experience point
total, she pays the cost (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the dorje in
addition to the experience point cost for making the dorje itself. The
act of working on the dorje costs a number of power points per day
equal to the power point cost of the power that is being embedded in
the crystal of the dorje.</p>
<p>Crafting a dorje requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the
base price.</p>

style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Craft Dorje</a>.</p>
<a id="creating-power-stones"></a><h6>Creating Power Stones</h6>
To create a power stone, a character needs a supply of incense and fine
etching tools, the cost of which is subsumed in the cost of encoding
the power stone:
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.5 gp x the level of the
power x the level of the
manifester</span>. </p>
</div>
<p>All materials used to imprint a power stone must be fresh
and unused. A character must pay the full cost for encoding each power
stone no matter how many times she previously has imprinted the same
power. </p>
<p>The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in
the power stone (or must have the power available in some other form).
If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester&#8217;s experience point
total, she pays the cost upon beginning the power stone in addition to
the experience point cost for making the power stone itself. The act of
encoding triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the
character an appropriate number of power points.</p>
<p>Encoding a power stone requires one day for each 1,000 gp of
the base price.</p>

style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Imprint Stone</a>. </p>
<a id="creating-psicrowns"></a><h6>Creating Psicrowns</h6>
To create a psicrown, a character needs a supply of materials, the most
obvious being a circlet, crown, or the pieces of the crown to be
assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of
creating the psicrown:
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">375 gp x the
level of the highest-level power x
the level of the manifester,
+ 75% of the value of the next
highest-level power (281.25 gp x the level of the power x the level of
the manifester),
+ one-half of the value of any other powers (187.5 gp
x the level of the power x the level of the manifester). </p>
<p>Psicrowns are
always created with full power points. </p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to have a higher manifester level
in the psicrown, you must pay for the psicrown as if the highest-level
power is one level higher for each additional two manifester levels you
want.</p>
<p>The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in
the psicrown (or must have the power available in some other form). If
any of the powers has an XP cost, the creator must provide XP equal to
50 x that cost. This expense is in addition to the experience point
cost for making the psicrown itself. The act of working on a psicrown
costs a number of power points per day equal to the cost of manifesting
each of the powers associated with the psicrown once per day.</p>
<p>Crafting a psicrown requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the
base price.</p>

<a id="creating-psionic-tattoos"></a><h6>Creating Psionic Tattoos</h6>
The creator of a psionic tattoo must have a patch of uncovered skin
free of hair and fur, and at least a few containers in which to mix
dyes. In addition, he needs special materials, usually to create dyes.
The costs for materials and dyes are subsumed in the cost for scribing
the psionic tattoo:
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">25
gp x the level of the power x the level of the
manifester.</span></div>
<p>All ingredients and materials used to scribe a psionic
tattoo must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost
for scribing each psionic tattoo. (Economies of scale do not apply.) </p>
<p>The user of the psionic tattoo is both the manifester and the
target; therefore, powers that target another creature cannot be stored
in psionic tattoo form. Powers with a range of personal can be made
into psionic tattoos, but they cost double the price of standard
psionic tattoos.</p>
<p>The creator must know the power to be placed in the psionic
tattoo (or must have the power available in some other form). If
manifesting the power would reduce the manifester&#8217;s XP total, he pays
the XP cost upon beginning the scribing in addition to the experience
point cost for making the psionic tattoo itself. The act of scribing
triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character
an appropriate number of power points.</p>
<p>Scribing a psionic tattoo requires one day.</p>

<a id="creating-universal-items"></a><h6>Creating Universal Items</h6>
To create a universal item, a character usually needs some sort of
equipment or tools to work on the item. He also needs a supply of
materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the
item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the
cost for creating the item. Universal item costs are difficult to
formularize. Refer to <a
href="magicItemsCreation.html#table-estimating-values"
style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold
Piece Values</a>
and use the given item prices as a guideline. Creating an item costs
half the market value listed.
<p>If powers are involved in the prerequisites for making the
item, the creator must know the power to be placed in the item (or must
have the power available in some other form). Any experience point cost
for a prerequisite power is not incurred by the creator of the item.
The act of working on the item requires a payment of power points
appropriate to the power or powers associated with the item during each
day of the item&#8217;s creation.</p>
<p>Crafting a universal item requires one day for each 1,000 gp
of the base price.</p>

<p class="initial">In addition to psionic items with imbedded
powers, some substances have innate special properties.
</p>
<a id="crystal-deep"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crystal, Deep:</span> Deep
crystal is crystal of above-average quality found at the hearts of
large veins or deposits of mundane crystal (see below). Deep crystal is
renowned for its strength and its psionically resonant nature. Mundane
crystal is used for many items of psionic manufacture, such as dorjes,
power stones, and psicrystals. Deep crystal is a better grade.</p>
<p>While a weapon made of deep crystal is no different from a
mundane crystal weapon for a nonpsionic character, a psionic wielder of
a deep crystal weapon can focus psionic power through it, increasing
the damage that weapon deals. As a free action that does not provoke
attacks of opportunity, the wielder can channel psionic power into a
melee weapon or ranged weapon made of deep crystal. For 2 power points,
the deep crystal weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. The weapon
will stay charged for 1 minute or until it scores its next hit. Bows,
crossbows, and slings bestow this power on their ammunition. All
missile weapons lose this effect if they miss. However, they may be
recovered and charged again.</p>
<p>Any weapon made of deep crystal costs 1,000 gp more than its
noncrystal counterpart. Any item could potentially be made out of deep
crystal. Because deep crystal armor is considered to be made out of
metal, druids cannot wear it.</p>
<p>Deep crystal has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and a
hardness of 10.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crystal, Mundane:</span>
Mundane crystal can be used in place of metal in weapons or armor,
using a special forging process. The fortified crystal possesses the
properties of a similar masterwork steel weapon or armor, except for
visual appearance.</p>
<p>Weapons and armor made of mundane crystal cost the same amount
to make as their masterwork counterparts. Any item could potentially be
made with mundane crystal. Because mundane crystal armor is considered
to be made out of metal, druids cannot wear it.</p>
<p>Mundane crystal properly forged has 25 hit points per inch of
thickness and a hardness of 8.</p>
