The d20 cosmology has six Inner Planes, four of which correspond to the classic
elements: <a style="color: #579eb6" href="planes.html#air">air</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="planes.html#earth">earth</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="planes.html#fire">fire</a>, and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="planes.html#water">water</a>. You can link races to various elements
without making them extraplanar creatures. In fact, you can create an entire philosophical
system based on various combinations of element types and their relative strengths.
<p>
The races described below are the elemental races tied to each element. While
members of these races are not actually <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#elemental">elementals</a>, and are, like most creatures,
composed of all four elements, each has a special affinity for one of the four.
This element has the most powerful influence on members of that race and strongly
shapes not only the race's physiology, but also its members' outlook and personality.
</p>
<p>
Despite their affinity for a particular element, these creatures types and subtypes
do not change.
</p>
<p>
Each racial variant modifies the race to which it is applied (the standard race)
in minor ways. All racial traits of the standard race (including racial skill
bonuses, bonus feats, special sensory capabilities, ability modifiers, combat
bonuses against specific foes, and racial weapon proficiencies) are retained unless
the variant specifies otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Most of these variant races provide alternate ability adjustments. The ability
score adjustments given here supersede the standard race's adjustments.
</p>
<p>
As with the environmental racial variants, the balanced and adaptable nature of
humans precludes them from having a strong elemental proclivity. The personality
of an individual human reflects, perhaps, the strength of various elements within
that individual, but humans gain no particular virtues or vulnerabilities related
to their elemental components.
</p>
<h2><a id="races-of-air"></a>Races Of Air</h2>
Traits associated with air include an intuitive and emotional nature. Creatures
with strong ties to the air element tend to be curious and investigative, capable
of influencing others with their words. Politically they believe in sacrifice
for a cause or belief.
<p>
Members of air races often differ in appearance from their typical cousins. Common
features include light blue or pale white skin, light blue or white hair, and
flesh that is cool to the touch.
</p>
<h4><a id="traits-of-air-races"></a>General Traits Of Air Races</h4>

Traits associated with earth include insight and thoughtfulness. Creatures with
strong ties to the earth element tend to be serious folk. Many are careful researchers
or masterful strategists. Politically they believe in self-reliance and in benefiting
from their own efforts. Members of earth races often vary in appearance from their
typical cousins. Common earth race features include earthlike skin, eyes like
gems or like black pits, gravelly voices, large hands and feet, iron gray hair,
and a metallic sheen to the skin.

Members of fire races are sensualists, existing to experience sensation of all

Politically they disdain constraints on behavior, especially moral or religious
inhibitions, or constraints imposed by conventional authority.
<p>
Members of fire races often vary in appearance from their normal cousins. Common
fire racial features include charcoal gray or deep red skin, red or orange hair
that waves like flames, unusually warm skin, and large red teeth.

Half-elves and half-orcs are part elemental race and part human. As a result, they

might have the charcoal gray skin, but not hair that waves like flames or large
red teeth.

Fire half-elves enjoy the finer things in life, but are not as hedonistic as their

Water races are creatures of sensation, but their response to it is more careful

consideration, but remain flexible and adaptable. Politically they are traditionalists,
more comfortable with proven systems than radical new ideas.

Members of water races often vary in appearance from their typical cousins. Common

feet.) A water creature can move through water at its swim speed without making
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#swim">Swim</a> checks. It has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special
