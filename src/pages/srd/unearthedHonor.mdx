Honor is a measuring stick that reflects a person�s worth in society,
trustworthiness, decency, and loyalty.
<p>
Honor can be used as a tool, similar to alignment, for defining
characters. In the extreme case, it can replace alignment. A game that
defines a character�s outlook based on his honor rather than his alignment
can still feature conflicts between good and evil, or law and chaos;
however these concepts are ideals rather than phenomena detectable by
spells.
</p>
<p>
You may choose to use honor as an actual game mechanic, tracking numbers
that change according to the characters� individual accomplishments.
Alternatively, you may choose to avoid mechanics, just as the alignment
system avoids them.
</p>
<p>
Using honor in your game requires a campaign with understood codes of
behavior. Individuals who act within the proper code are considered
honorable by others. Those who act outside their code are considered
dishonorable, and not to be trusted. As the GM, you are responsible for
creating these codes of honor. Several examples appear later in this
section.

<h5><a id="mechanical-honor"></a>
MECHANICAL HONOR
</h5>
This system proposes a way to determine a starting honor score for each
character, and how a character�s actions affect his honor score
thereafter.
<h6><a id="starting-honor"></a>
Starting Honor
</h6>
A character�s alignment determines his starting honor score, with lawful
alignments tending to have higher scores than chaotic or neutral, and good
alignments tending to have higher scores than evil or neutral. See
<a style="color: 579eb6" href="#table-starting-honor-scores">Table: Starting Honor Scores</a>.
<h6><a id="earning-honor"></a>
Earning Honor
</h6>
Honor comes from action, not inaction. While a character can lose honor by
not acting, he cannot gain honor by refusing to act. Actions that increase
one�s honor score vary, depending on the individual character�s code (see
<a href="#sample-codes-of-honor">Sample Codes of Honor</a>, below). Some examples of actions and their impact
on a character�s honor score appear in <a style="color: 579eb6" href="#table-earning-and-losing-honor">Table: Earning and Losing Honor</a>.
<h6><a id="losing-honor"></a>
Losing Honor
</h6>
Depending on the character�s code of honor, dishonorable actions &mdash; those
that reduce one�s honor score &mdash; may include any of the examples in
<a style="color: 579eb6" href="#table-earning-and-losing-honor">Table: Earning and Losing Honor</a>.

It is important to remember that the benefits of honor only apply when
interacting with someone who shares the same or similar honor code. Refer
to the following table, using the row that relates to your honor score,
when you interact with someone of that sort.

FREE-FORM HONOR
</h5>
<a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/UnA_Gallery/79179.jpg"><img
class="art-wide" src="pict.jpg" title="" alt="pict"
style="border: 0px solid ; width: 73px; height: 75px;" /></a>
Here are some guidelines for determining a character�s honor according to
the character�s actions or according to alignment.
<h6><a id="measuring-free-form-honor"></a>
Measuring Free-Form Honor
</h6>
No game mechanic measures or tracks a character�s honor in this system,
just as no game mechanic measures or tracks a character�s alignment. Honor
functions as a tool for developing a character�s identity, not as a
straitjacket. As part of creating a character, a player should decide
whether he intends to play the character as a paragon of virtue, a
dishonorable scoundrel, or something in between &mdash; perhaps someone who
struggles to live honorably but too often succumbs to temptation. As a
general guideline, consider these five �ranks� of honor.
<p><b><a id="honorless"></a>Honorless:</b> An honorless character does not adhere to any code, and mocks such codes
as irrelevant ideals. Such a character cannot be trusted, for betrayal
comes as naturally to this person as breathing. An honorless character is
usually both chaotic and evil.
</p>
<p><b><a id="untrustworthy"></a>Untrustworthy:</b> Codes are an inconvenience to untrustworthy characters, who see them as
tools best used to manipulate others. Such a person would betray almost
anyone in the right circumstances, but can usually be relied on to come to
the aid of his guild, clan, club, or other association. With self-interest
taking precedence above all, such characters are usually chaotic or
neutral, and often evil.
</p>
<p><b><a id="honorable-in-action"></a>Honorable in Action:</b> A character may act according to a code of honor even though his heart and
mind are not in it. Subordinating one�s own interests to those of a group
is difficult for such a character, and living up to the ideals of his code
is a constant struggle. With each successful bout against temptation,
however, the character�s resolve grows stronger. This minimum standard of
honor usually represents a neutral alignment, with leanings toward law.
</p>
<p><b><a id="honorable-in-thought"></a>Honorable in Thought:</b> A highly honorable character does not doubt his code or its demands. Such
a person, while not free from temptation, easily overcomes it. The
difficulty comes when the character is forced to bend rules, however
slightly &mdash; because doing this is a challenge for the highly honorable
character. Such characters are usually lawful neutral.
</p>
<p><b><a id="honorable-in-soul"></a>Honorable in Soul:</b> A paragon of honor cannot be swayed from the call of duty to family, clan,
guild, or other association. To even question the honor of such a
character is unthinkable. Characters so immersed in honor are selfless,
completely devoted to their association, and willing to give up their
lives for the safety and security of others. They are usually lawful
neutral or lawful good.
</p>
<h6><a id="benefits-of-free-form-honor"></a>
Benefits of Honor
</h6>
Under a free-form system, the GM must determine how much a character
benefits from honor. A character who is honorable in soul should benefit
more than an untrustworthy or honorless character, for example. Someone
with an opposing code of honor reacts differently to a character than one
with a similar code.
<p>
Potential benefits of honor include the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A +1 <a style="color: 579eb6" href="feats.html#leadership">Leadership</a> score modifier
for fairness and generosity.
</p></li>
<li><p>A +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks.
</p></li>
<li><p>A +2 circumstance bonus on Sense Motive checks when the target is
behaving dishonorably.
</p></li>
<li><p>A +1 circumstance bonus on Will saves when the consequence of failing
the save would bring dishonor on the character.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
At the GM�s discretion, other known associates of a character with a
reputation for honorable behavior may also receive the bonus.
</p>
<p>
If you�re also using the <a style="color: 579eb6" href="unearthedReputation.html">reputation</a> rules,
you can apply a bonus on reputation checks based on a
character�s status as an honorable or dishonorable person.
</p>
<h5><a id="family-honor"></a>
FAMILY HONOR
</h5>
A common concept in games and fiction that involve honor codes is family
honor. The idea is that characters can �inherit� some portion of their
family�s reputation for honor, or dishonor.

<p>
When using family honor under the mechanical system, a character�s
starting honor score can be affected by several factors related to the
family�s status (honorable or dishonorable), alignment, and preference for
a particular class, as shown below.
</p>
<p>
For example, Annoth comes from an honorable family and a long line of
fighters. Since he is also a fighter, his starting honor score gets a +1
increase. His alignment is the same as that of the majority of his family
members, so his starting honor score gets an additional +2 increase.
</p>
<p>
Hero Builder�s Guidebook contains five tables in the section titled
Creating Your Personal History that have information useful in a
mechanical honor system. They are Table 6: Family Private Ethics, Table 7:
Family Public Ethics, Table 8: Family Religious Commitment, Table 9:
Family Reputation, and Table 10: Family Political Views. These family
characteristics, if used in the game, affect a character�s starting honor
score as shown below.
</p>
<p>
When using the free-form honor system, the categories defined under
Measuring Free-Form Honor also apply to families.
</p>
<p>
Characters who are as honorable as their families, or more honorable, get
more honor benefits (see <a style="color: 579eb6" href="#benefits-of-free-form-honor">Benefits of Honor</a>) than those who are less
honorable than their families.
</p>
<h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-honor-and-alignment"></a>
BEHIND THE CURTAIN: HONOR AND ALIGNMENT
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">Lawful neutral and lawful good characters are generally what people think
of when they imagine honorable characters. Honor is about obeying a code,
either because a character wants to live up to society�s expectations for
the rewards that doing so provides, or because something inside her
compels her to live in accordance with a set of beliefs. Thus, it is
possible to be chaotic and still live in a way that society considers
honorable.
<p>
Good-aligned characters have many reasons to live honorably. Good implies
altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient
beings. Such characters are often compelled by their own hearts to live
according to an honor code.
</p>
<p>
Evil is a slightly more complex issue. Lawful evil characters may behave
honorably toward their followers and associates because doing so furthers
their cause. They may even treat respected foes with honor, while
oppressing everyone else. Neutral evil characters are likely only to see
honor in treating their associates and followers with fairness and
generosity, provided those people are necessary for the neutral evil
character�s cause.
</p>
<p>
Chaotic evil characters, however, use honor as a way to trick others.
While they and their associates may possess no honor of their own, they
understand what it is and how to manipulate others through it.
</p></div>

<h5><a id="sample-codes-of-honor"></a>
SAMPLE CODES OF HONOR
</h5>
Here are some codes of honor drawn from fiction and history.
<h6><a id="bushido"></a>
Bushido
</h6>
Bushido is the code of the samurai from ancient Japan. Many books have
been written about how a samurai should live, including the Go Rin No Sho
(Book of Five Rings) and the Hagakure. According to one version of the
code, a samurai must possess the following seven virtues.
<ul>
<li><p>
<i>Gi (honesty and justice)</i>: A samurai deals openly and honestly
with others and cleaves to the ideals of justice. Moral decisions do not
come in shades of gray, only right and wrong.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<i>Yu (heroic courage)</i>: A samurai never fears to act, but lives
life fully and wonderfully. Respect and caution replace fear.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<i>Jin (compassion)</i>: A samurai takes every opportunity to aid
others, and creates opportunities when they do not arise. As a powerful
individual, a samurai has a responsibility to use that power to help
others.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<i>Rei (polite courtesy)</i>: A samurai has no reason to be cruel, and
no need to prove his strength. Courtesy distinguishes a samurai from an
animal, and reveals one�s true strength.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<i>Meyo (honor)</i>: A samurai�s conscience is the judge of his honor.
The decisions he makes and how he carries them out are a reflection of
his true nature.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<i>Makoto (complete sincerity)</i>: When a samurai has said that he
shall perform an action, it is as good as done. He need not make
promises; speaking and doing are as if the same.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<i>Chugo (duty and loyalty)</i>: A samurai feels responsible for his
actions and their consequences, and loyal to the people in his care. A
samurai�s loyalty to his lord is unquestionable and unquestioning.
</p></li>
</ul>

</h6>
The Knight Protectors, a loose organization of chivalric-minded warriors
described in Complete Warrior, hold to this code of honor. It makes a fine
code for lawful knights.
<ul>
<li><p>Courage and enterprise in obedience to the Order.
</p></li>
<li><p>Defense of any mission unto death.
</p></li>
<li><p>Respect for all peers and equals; courtesy to all lessers.
</p></li>
<li><p>Combat is glory; battle is the true test of self-worth; war is the
flowering of the chivalric ideal.
</p></li>
<li><p>Personal glory above all else in battle.
</p></li>
<li><p>Death before dishonor.
</p></li>
</ul>

Omerta
</h6>
The �code of silence� of the Cosa Nostra isn�t codified or written down.
It makes a good code for a thieves� guild or other criminal organization.
One interpretation is as follows.
<ul>
<li><p>Do what you�re told by your superiors.
</p></li>
<li><p>Always look out for ways to make money for the Family.
</p></li>
<li><p>Do not hide or hold back money from the Family.
</p></li>
<li><p>Respect your elders in the Family, and in the Organization in general.
</p></li>
<li><p>Never let a debt go unpaid.
</p></li>
<li><p>Never be late paying your debts.
</p></li>
<li><p>Don�t get caught.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you do get caught, keep your mouth shut.
</p></li>
</ul>

or chaotic ends).

</p></li>
</ul>
<h6><a id="dont-tread-on-me"></a>
Don�t Tread on Me

This relatively short code of honor works well for barbarians, fighters,
and rangers.
<ul>
<li><p>I won�t be wronged.
</p></li>
<li><p>I won�t be insulted.
</p></li>
<li><p>I won�t be laid a hand on.

</ul>
<h6><a id="thieves-code"></a>
Thieves� Code
</h6>
�Honorable� thieves in a guild might abide by a code similar to this one.
<ul>
<li><p>Never steal from another member of the guild.
</p></li>
<li><p>Never perform another thief�s assigned task or �steal� jobs from
another thief.
</p></li>
<li><p>Never let your own jobs interfere with the guild�s jobs.
</p></li>
<li><p>Don�t attract attention to the guild, especially not the attention of
the town fathers.
</p></li>
<li><p>10% of the take from your jobs goes to the guild; you keep the rest.
</p></li>
<li><p>100% of the take from guild-assigned thefts goes to the guild, and
maybe you get a taste.
</p></li>
<li><p>Don�t kill anyone in the commission of a job, except in selfdefense.
It attracts too much attention.
</p></li>
</ul>
