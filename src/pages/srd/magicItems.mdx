<h2 style="margin-top: -40px; margin-bottom: 0px"><span class="subtitle">The Basics</span>
</h2>
<p class="initial">Magic items are divided into categories:
armor, weapons, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, and
wondrous items. In addition, some magic items are cursed or
intelligent. Finally, a few magic items are of such rarity and power
that they are considered to belong to a category of their own:
artifacts. Artifacts are classified in turn as minor (extremely rare
but not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one unique and extremely
potent).</p>
<a id="magic-armor-and-shields"></a><p><b>Armor and Shields</b>: Magic armor (including shields)
offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. Some of these items
confer abilities beyond a benefit to Armor Class. </p>
<a id="magic-weapons"></a><p><b>Weapons</b>: Magic weapons are created with a variety of
combat powers and almost always improve the attack and damage rolls of
the wielder as well.</p>
<a id="magic-potions"></a><p><b>Potions</b>: A potion is an elixir concocted with a
spell-like effect that affects only the drinker.</p>
<a id="magic-rings"></a><p><b>Rings</b>: A ring is a circular metal band worn on the
finger (no more than two rings per wearer) that has a spell-like power
(often a constant effect that affects the wearer).</p>
<a id="magic-rods"></a><p><b>Rods</b>: A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power
unlike that of any known spell.</p>
<a id="magic-scrolls"></a><p><b>Scrolls</b>: A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto
paper or parchment so that it can be used later.</p>
<a id="magic-staffs"></a><p><b>Staffs</b>: A staff has a number of different (but often
related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 50 charges, and each
use of the staff depletes one or more of those charges.</p>
<a id="magic-wands"></a><p><b>Wands</b>: A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to
cast a specific spell. A newly created wand has 50 charges, and each
use of the wand depletes one of those charges.</p>
<a id="magic-wondrous-items"></a><p><b>Wondrous Items</b>: These objects include magic jewelry,
tools, books, clothing, and much more.</p>
<a id="magic-items-and-detect-magic"></a><h6>Magic Items and Detect Magic</h6>
<p class="initial">When detect magic identifies a magic
item&rsquo;s
school of magic, this information refers to the school of the spell
placed within the potion, scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given
for the item. The description of each item provides its aura strength
and the school it belongs to.</p>
<p>If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the
highest-level spell. If no spells are included in the prerequisites,
use the following default guidelines.</p>

<a id="using-items"></a><h5>USING ITEMS</h5>
<p class="initial">To use a magic item, it must be activated,
although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your
finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases,
using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks
of opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like
spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item
description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell
is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless
of the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically
states otherwise.</p>
<p>The four ways to activate magic items are described below.</p>
<a id="spell-completion"></a><p><b>Spell Completion</b>: This is the activation method for
scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation
is done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as
with normal spellcasting. All that&rsquo;s left to do is perform the
finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so
on). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high
enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he
can&rsquo;t
already cast the spell, there&rsquo;s a chance he&rsquo;ll make a
mistake.
Activating a spell completion item is a standard action and provokes
attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.</p>
<a id="spell-trigger"></a><p><b>Spell Trigger</b>: Spell trigger activation is similar to
spell completion, but it&rsquo;s even simpler. No gestures or spell
finishing
is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate
character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Anyone
with a spell on his or her spell list knows how to use a spell trigger
item that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who
can&rsquo;t actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin.) The
user must
still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can
activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and
does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<a id="command-word"></a><p><b>Command Word</b>: If no activation method is suggested
either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item,
assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word
activation means that a character speaks the word and the item
activates. No other special knowledge is needed.</p>
<p>A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case,
the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item
accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often,
the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or
phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a
command word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke
attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written
right on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or
design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item
might bear a clue to the command word.</p>
<p>The Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be
useful in helping to identify command words or deciphering clues
regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up
with the word itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second
check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue.</p>
<p>The spells identify and analyze dweomer both reveal command
words.</p>
<a id="use-activated"></a><p><b>Use Activated</b>: This type of item simply has to be used
in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a
sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a
lens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is
generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears.
Continually functioning items are practically always items that one
wears. A few must simply be in the character&rsquo;s possession (on his
person). However, some items made for wearing must still be activated.
Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above),
usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The
description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such
a case.</p>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item
is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not
provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an
action that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of
the item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation
is a standard action. If the item&rsquo;s activation is subsumed in its
use
and takes no extra time use activation is not an action at all.</p>
<p>Use activation doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you use an item, you
automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess)
what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it,
unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such from drinking
a potion or swinging a sword.</p>
<a id="size-and-magic-items"></a><h5>SIZE AND MAGIC ITEMS</h5>
<p class="initial">When an article of magic clothing or jewelry
is discovered, most of the time size shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. Many
magic
garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves
magically to the wearer. Size should not keep characters of various
kinds from using magic items.</p>
<p>There may be rare exceptions, especially with racial specific
items. </p>
<a id="armor-and-weapon-sizes"></a><p><b>Armor and Weapon Sizes</b>: Armor and weapons that are
found at random have a 30% chance of being Small (01&ndash;30), a 60%
chance
of being Medium (31&ndash;90), and a 10% chance of being any other size
(91&ndash;100).</p>
<a id="magic-items-on-the-body"></a><h5>MAGIC ITEMS ON THE BODY</h5>
<p class="initial">Many magic items need to be donned by a
character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities.
It&rsquo;s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear
as
many as twelve magic items at the same time. However, each of those
items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.</p>
<p>A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear
consisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to
which place on the body the item is worn.</p>
<ul>
<li>One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head</li>
<li>One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the eyes</li>
<li>One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab
around the neck</li>
<li>One vest, vestment, or shirt on the torso</li>
<li>One robe or suit of armor on the body (over a vest,
vestment, or shirt)</li>
<li>One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of armor)</li>
<li>One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a
robe or suit of armor)</li>
<li>One pair of bracers or bracelets on the arms or wrists</li>
<li>One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the hands</li>
<li>One ring on each hand (or two rings on one hand)</li>
<li>One pair of boots or shoes on the feet</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of
the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those
listed above have no effect. </p>
<p>Some items can be worn or carried without taking up space on a
character&rsquo;s body. The description of an item indicates when an
item has
this property.</p>
<a id="saving-throws-against-magic-item-powers"></a><h5>SAVING THROWS AGAINST MAGIC ITEM POWERS</h5>
<p class="initial">Magic items produce spells or spell-like
effects. For a saving throw against a spell or spell-like effect from a
magic item, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the
ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level
of spell. </p>
<p>Staffs are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as
if the wielder cast the spell, including caster level and all modifiers
to save DC. </p>
<p>Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various
effects, particularly when the effect has no exact spell equivalent
(making its level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).</p>
<a id="damaging-magic-items"></a><h5>DAMAGING MAGIC ITEMS</h5>
<p class="initial">A magic item doesn&rsquo;t need to make a
saving
throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the
effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items
should always get a saving throw against spells that might deal damage
to them&mdash; even against attacks from which a nonmagical item would
normally get no chance to save. Magic items use the same saving throw
bonus for all saves, no matter what the type (Fortitude, Reflex, or
Will). A magic item&rsquo;s saving throw bonus equals 2 + one-half its
caster
level (round down). The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic
items, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.</p>
<p>Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical
items of the same sort. A damaged magic item continues to function, but
if it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.</p>
<a id="repairing-magic-items"></a><h5>REPAIRING MAGIC ITEMS</h5>
<p class="initial">Some magic items take damage over the course
of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a magic item with the Craft
skill than it does to repair its nonmagical counterpart. The make whole
spell also repairs a damaged&mdash;but not completely
broken&mdash;magic item.</p>
<a id="intelligent-items"></a><h5>INTELLIGENT ITEMS</h5>
<p class="initial">Some magic items, particularly weapons, have
an intelligence all their own. Only permanent magic items (as opposed
to those with a single use or those with charges) can be intelligent.
(This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are
never intelligent.)</p>
<p>In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence. </p>
<a id="cursed-items"></a><h5>CURSED ITEMS</h5>
<p class="initial">Some items are cursed&mdash;incorrectly made,
or
corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly
dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw,
an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly
generated items are cursed 5% of the time. </p>
<a id="charges-doses-and-multiple-uses"></a><h5>CHARGES, DOSES, AND MULTIPLE USES</h5>
<p class="initial">Many items, particularly wands and staffs, are
limited in power by the number of charges they hold. Normally, charged
items have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random
part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of
charges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number
of charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges
are left. </p>
<p>Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an
item is created, it is fully charged.) For an item that&rsquo;s
worthless
when its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged
items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the
number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to
its charges, only part of the item&rsquo;s value is based on the number
of
charges left.</p>
<a id="magic-item-descriptions"></a><h3>MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="initial">Each general type of magic item gets an
overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.</p>
<p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random
generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break
DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes
that the item is unattended and includes a &ndash;5 penalty for the
item&rsquo;s
effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the
creature&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier in place of the &ndash;5 penalty.</p>
<p>Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells
and nothing else, don&rsquo;t get full-blown descriptions. Reference
the
spell&rsquo;s description for details, modified by the form of the item
(potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the
minimum level required to cast it</p>
<p>Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and
each of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end
of the description.</p>
<a id="aura"></a><p><b>Aura</b>: Most of the time, a detect magic spell will
reveal the school of magic associated with a magic item and the
strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable)
is given at the beginning of the item&rsquo;s notational entry. See the
detect magic spell description for details.</p>
<a id="caster-level"></a><p><b>Caster Level</b>: The next item in a notational entry gives
the caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster
level determines the item&rsquo;s saving throw bonus, as well as range
or
other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).
It also determines the level that must be contended with should the
item come under the effect of a dispel magic spell or similar
situation. This information is given in the form &ldquo;CL x,&rdquo;
where &ldquo;CL&rdquo; is
an abbreviation for caster level and &ldquo;x&rdquo; is an ordinal
number
representing the caster level itself.</p>
<p>For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the
caster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored
spell and not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items,
the caster level is determined by the creator. The minimum caster level
is that which is needed to meet the prerequisites given.</p>
<a id="prerequisites"></a><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Certain requirements must be met in
order for a character to create a magic item. These include feats,
spells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and
race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given
immediately following the item&rsquo;s caster level.</p>
<p>A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has
prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer
or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger
magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell
effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator
must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell
trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a
prerequisite.</p>
<p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the
creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the
prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.</p>
<p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they
must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the
purpose of determinations where the creator&rsquo;s level must be
known. The
character designated as the creator pays the XP required to make the
item.</p>
<p>Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one
or more spells (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).
When two spells at the end of a list are separated by &ldquo;or,&rdquo;
one of
those spells is required in addition to every other spell mentioned
prior to the last two.</p>
<a id="market-price"></a><p><b>Market Price</b>: This gold piece value, given following
the word &ldquo;Price,&rdquo; represents the price someone should
expect to pay to
buy the item. The market price for an item that can be constructed with
an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price
for any components (material or XP).</p>
<a id="cost-to-create"></a><p><b>Cost to Create</b>: The next part of a notational entry is
the cost in gp and XP to create the item, given following the word
&ldquo;Cost.&rdquo; This information appears only for items with
components
(material or XP), which make their market prices higher than their base
prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base
cost plus the costs of the components. Items without components do not
have a &ldquo;Cost&rdquo; entry. For them, the market price and the
base price are
the same. The cost in gp is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in XP is
1/25 the market price.</p>
<a id="weight"></a><p><b>Weight</b>: The notational entry for many wondrous items
ends with a value for the item&rsquo;s weight. When a weight figure is
not
given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining
how much of a load a character can carry).</p>
