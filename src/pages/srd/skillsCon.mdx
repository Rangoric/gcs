<h5>CONCENTRATION (CON)</h5>
<p class="initial">Check: You must make a Concentration check
whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by
harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires
your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell,
concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like
ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity.
In general, if an action wouldn&#8217;t normally provoke an attack of
opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being
distracted.</p>
<p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the
action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails
and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell
is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends
as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a
spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were
using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill
use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other
ramifications as well.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that
cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs
while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the
spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If
more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each
one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not
completed.</p>

<p><b>Action</b>: None. Making a Concentration check doesn&#8217;t take
an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or
part of another action (when attempted actively).</p>
<p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, though a success doesn&#8217;t cancel the
effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were
casting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use
a spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid
attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn&#8217;t apply to other actions
that might provoke attacks of opportunity. The DC of the check is 15
(plus the spell&#8217;s level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like
ability defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may
attempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of
opportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn&#8217;t allow you
to take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you
must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the
related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate
ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration
had been disrupted by a distraction. </p>
