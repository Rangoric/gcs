<p class="initial">Combat is cyclical; everybody acts in turn in
a regular cycle of rounds. Combat follows this sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each combatant starts out flat-footed. Once a combatant
acts, he or she is no longer flat-footed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine which characters are aware of their opponents at
the start of the battle. If some but not all of the combatants are
aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular
rounds of combat begin. The combatants who are aware of the opponents
can act in the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In
initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle
aware of their opponents each take one action (either a standard action
or a move action) during the surprise round. Combatants who were
unaware do not get to act in the surprise round. If no one or everyone
starts the battle aware, there is no surprise round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combatants who have not yet rolled initiative do so. All
combatants are now ready to begin their first regular round of combat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the
highest initiative acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat
ends.</p>

<p class="initial">This section summarizes the statistics that
determine success in combat, and then details how to use</p>
<a id="attack-roll"></a><h5>ATTACK ROLL</h5>
<p class="initial">An attack roll represents your attempt to
strike your opponent on your turn in a round. When you make an attack
roll, you roll a d20 and add your attack bonus. (Other modifiers may
also apply to this roll.) If your result equals or beats the target&#8217;s
Armor Class, you hit and deal damage.</p>
<a id="automatic-misses-and-hits"></a><p><b>Automatic Misses and Hits</b>: A natural 1 (the d20 comes
up 1) on an attack roll is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes
up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat&#8212;a possible
critical hit.</p>
<a id="attack-bonus"></a><h5>ATTACK BONUS</h5>
<p>Your attack bonus with a melee weapon is:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + size modifier</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>With a ranged weapon, your attack bonus is:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier + size modifier +
range penalty</b></dd>

<a id="damage"></a><h5>DAMAGE</h5>
<p class="initial">When your attack succeeds, you deal damage.
The type of weapon used determines the amount of damage you deal.
Effects that modify weapon damage apply to unarmed strikes and the
natural physical attack forms of creatures.</p>
<p>Damage reduces a target&#8217;s current hit points.</p>
<a id="minimum-damage"></a><p><b>Minimum Damage</b>: If penalties reduce the damage result
to less than 1, a hit still deals 1 point of damage.</p>
<a id="strength--bonus"></a><p><b>Strength Bonus</b>: When you hit with a melee or thrown
weapon, including a sling, add your Strength modifier to the damage
result. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies on attacks made
with a bow that is not a composite bow.</p>
<a id="off-hand-weapon"></a><p><i>Off-Hand Weapon</i>: When you deal damage with a weapon in
your off hand, you add only 1/2 your Strength bonus.</p>
<a id="wielding-a-weapon-two-handed"></a><p><i>Wielding a Weapon Two-Handed</i>: When you deal damage with
a weapon that you are wielding two-handed, you add 1-1/2 times your
Strength bonus. However, you don&#8217;t get this higher Strength bonus when
using a light weapon with two hands.</p>
<a id="multiplying-damage"></a><p><b>Multiplying Damage</b>: Sometimes you multiply damage by
some factor, such as on a critical hit. Roll the damage (with all
modifiers) multiple times and total the results. Note: When you
multiply damage more than once, each multiplier works off the original,
unmultiplied damage.</p>
<p><i>Exception</i>: Extra damage dice over and above a weapon&#8217;s
normal damage are never multiplied.</p>
<a id="ability-damage"></a><p><b>Ability Damage</b>: Certain creatures and magical effects
can cause temporary ability damage (a reduction to an ability score).</p>
<a id="armor-class"></a><h5>ARMOR CLASS</h5>
<p class="initial">Your Armor Class (AC) represents how hard it
is for opponents to land a solid, damaging blow on you. It&#8217;s the attack
roll result that an opponent needs to achieve to hit you. Your AC is
equal to the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><b>10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + Dexterity modifier +
size modifier</b></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that armor limits your Dexterity bonus, so if you&#8217;re
wearing armor, you might not be able to apply your whole Dexterity
bonus to your AC.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can&#8217;t use your Dexterity bonus (if you have
one). If you can&#8217;t react to a blow, you can&#8217;t use your Dexterity bonus
to AC. (If you don&#8217;t have a Dexterity bonus, nothing happens.)</p>
<a id="armor-other-modifiers"></a><p><b>Other Modifiers</b>: Many other factors modify your AC.</p>
<a id="armor-enhancement-bonuses"></a><p><b>Enhancement Bonuses</b>: Enhancement effects make your
armor better.</p>
<a id="deflection-bonus"></a><p><i>Deflection Bonus</i>: Magical deflection effects ward off
attacks and improve your AC.</p>
<a id="natural-armor"></a><p><i>Natural Armor</i>: Natural armor improves your AC.</p>
<a id="dodge-bonuses"></a><p><i>Dodge Bonuses</i>: Some other AC bonuses represent actively
avoiding blows. These bonuses are called dodge bonuses. Any situation
that denies you your Dexterity bonus also denies you dodge bonuses.
(Wearing armor, however, does not limit these bonuses the way it limits
a Dexterity bonus to AC.) Unlike most sorts of bonuses, dodge bonuses
stack with each other.</p>
<a id="touch-attacks"></a><p><b>Touch Attacks</b>: Some attacks disregard armor, including
shields and natural armor. In these cases, the attacker makes a touch
attack roll (either ranged or melee). When you are the target of a
touch attack, your AC doesn&#8217;t include any armor bonus, shield bonus, or
natural armor bonus. All other modifiers, such as your size modifier,
Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) apply normally.</p>
<a id="hit-points"></a><h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
<p class="initial">When your hit point total reaches 0, you&#8217;re
disabled. When it reaches &#8211;1, you&#8217;re dying. When it gets to &#8211;10, you&#8217;re
dead.</p>
<a id="speed"></a><h5>SPEED</h5>
<p class="initial">Your speed tells you how far you can move in a
round and still do something, such as attack or cast a spell. Your
speed depends mostly on your race and what armor you&#8217;re wearing.</p>
<p>Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have a speed of 20 feet (4
squares), or 15 feet (3 squares) when wearing medium or heavy armor
(except for dwarves, who move 20 feet in any armor).</p>
<p>Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have a speed of 30
feet (6 squares), or 20 feet (4 squares) in medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p>If you use two move actions in a round (sometimes called a
&#8220;double move&#8221; action), you can move up to double your speed. If you
spend the entire round to run all out, you can move up to quadruple
your speed (or triple if you are in heavy armor).</p>
<a id="saving-throws"></a><h5>SAVING THROWS</h5>
<p class="initial">Generally, when you are subject to an unusual
or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the
effect. Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll plus a bonus
based on your class, level, and an ability score. Your saving throw
modifier is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><b>Base save bonus + ability modifier</b></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<a id="saving-throw-types"></a><p><b>Saving Throw Types</b>: The three different kinds of saving
throws are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will:</p>
<a id="fotitude"></a><p><i>Fortitude</i>: These saves measure your ability to stand up
to physical punishment or attacks against your vitality and health.
Apply your Constitution modifier to your Fortitude saving throws. </p>
<a id="fortitude"></a><p><i>Reflex</i>: These saves test your ability to dodge area
attacks. Apply your Dexterity modifier to your Reflex saving throws. </p>
<a id="will"></a><p><i>Will</i>: These saves reflect your resistance to mental
influence as well as many magical effects. Apply your Wisdom modifier
to your Will saving throws.</p>
<a id="saving-throw-difficulty-class"></a><p><b>Saving Throw Difficulty Class</b>: The DC for a save is
determined by the attack itself.</p>
<a id="automatic-failures-and-successes"></a><p><b>Automatic Failures and Successes</b>: A natural 1 (the d20
comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure (and may cause damage
to exposed items; see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw). A natural
20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</p>
