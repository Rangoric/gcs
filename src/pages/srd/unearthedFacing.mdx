The standard d20 combat rules intentionally ignore the direction a
creature faces. The rules assume that creatures are constantly moving and
shifting within their spaces, looking in all directions during a fight. In
this variant, facing � the direction your head and body are pointing � makes a
big difference in how you move and fight.
<p>
This variant makes combat more complex, but it opens up new strategic
options for PCs and monsters alike. It�s a good choice if your group
relishes the tactical complexity of d20 combat and doesn�t mind spending a
lot of time duking it out with the bad guys. It won�t change the power
level of your game.
</p>
<p>
This variant supersedes the standard rules for flanking and creates new
conditions for the rogue�s use of the sneak attack ability.
</p>
<h5><a id="facing-direction"></a>
FACING DIRECTION
</h5>
All PCs and most monsters have a facing: the direction to the adjacent
square the character or creature is pointing toward. This means that a
Medium creature standing in a given square has eight possible facings. The
three squares a Small or Medium character is pointing toward are its front
area. The three squares behind it are its rear area. The squares to its
left and right are its flanks. Larger characters have more squares to deal
with, but they still face toward one of eight directions. Their front
areas remain the squares in front of them (including those on the front
corners); their rear areas remain the squares behind them (including those
on the rear corners); and their flanks remain the squares directly to
their sides.
<p>
For some miniatures, it�s obvious which direction they�re facing; their
faces are pointed in a particular direction, and they�re brandishing a
weapon in that direction too. But some miniatures look one way and point
their weapons another, or it�s otherwise unclear which way they�re facing.
To keep things clear at the gaming table, it�s easiest if you mark the
front of each miniature with a small dot or arrow on the base. That way
everyone knows which way the character represented by the miniature is
facing.
</p>
<p>
Some creatures simply have no facing. See <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#faceless-creatures">Faceless Creatures</a>, below.

<h5><a id="facing-and-movement"></a>
FACING AND MOVEMENT
</h5>
Facing has some significant effects on movement.
<p><b><a id="changing-facing"></a>Changing Facing:</b>
As you move, you can freely change your facing, rotating your miniature
before you step into each new square. In addition, you can change facing
at the end of your move. These rules do not apply if your movement is
limited to a 5-foot step; see below.
</p>
<p>
If you do not move during your turn, or if your movement is limited to a
5-foot step, you may change facing once, at any point during your turn, as
a free action.
You can turn to face any direction you like, but you cannot change facing
more than once. (You can also change facing as a move action, however, if
you aren�t using your move action to do something else.)
</p>
<p><b><a id="normal-movement"></a>Normal Movement:</b> You can move into any square in your front area at the normal movement
cost. As you move, you may change your facing as you enter each new
square. Make it clear which way you�re facing as you move, if it matters
(such as when enemies are near), and set your miniature�s facing when
you�re done moving. (If your miniature is on a square base, the corners of
the base may extend beyond the miniature�s space. That�s okay, but
remember that regardless of your facing, the size and shape of your space
never actually changes.)
</p>
<p><b><a id="moving-backwards-or-sideways"></a>Moving Backward or Sideways:</b>
In general, you�ll usually turn your character in the direction of
movement before making a move. (As described above, you may freely make
such changes in facing during movement.) However, sometimes you�ll want to
move without changing your facing, to avoid exposing your flank or rear
area to an attack of opportunity while you move. It costs two squares of
movement to enter a square on your flank or in your rear area.
</p>
<p><b><a id="five-foot-steps"></a>5-Foot Steps:</b>
When taking a 5-foot step, you can move into any adjacent square, even
squares in your rear or on your flank.
</p>
<p>
You do not change facing when taking a 5-foot step. (You may, however,
change your facing once as a free action; see
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="#changing-facing">Changing Facing</a>, above.)
</p>

<p>
When the rogue moves out past the fighter, she provokes an attack of
opportunity. Because the fighter is in her flank area, he gets a +2
bonus on the <a href=

</p>

</td>
<td style="padding-right:20px">
<img src="AoOFig2.png" alt=
"Diagram: Attacks of Opportunity Figure 2" width="202" height="162" />
<p>
The rogue can move sideways past the fighter without facing the
direction she�s moving bu it costs her two squares of movement to
enter each square. The fighter still gets an attack of opportunity,
but he doesn�t get the +2 bonus because he�s standing in the rogue�s
front area.
</p>
</td>
<td>
<img src="AoOFig3.png" alt=
"Diagram: Attacks of Opportunity Figure 3" width="202" height="162" />

<p>
If the rogue moves around the back of the fighter, he can still make
an attack of opportunity, but at a -10 penalty because the rogue is
in the fighter�s rear area. The fighter also gets a +2 bonus because
he�s in the rogue�s flank area when he attacks.
</p>

<h5><a id="facing-and-attacking"></a>
FACING AND ATTACKING
</h5>
In general, a character can attack into any square in his front area
without penalty. This means that a character making a full attack should
consider carefully when he takes his free action to change
his facing. For example, if 6th-level Kroh is beset by a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersAtoB.html#bugbear">bugbear</a> in his
front area and a goblin in his rear area, he can attack the bugbear, take
his free action to change facing towards the goblin, then attack the
goblin. But he can�t then change his facing again. He�s stuck with his
back to the bugbear, which is in his rear area.
<p>
Characters who don�t want to change their facing to point toward a foe can
attack into their flank areas at a -5 penalty and into their rear areas at
a -10 penalty.
</p>
<p>
Characters can make ranged attacks into any square beyond their front area
without penalty, as shown in the accompanying diagram. The penalties for
making ranged attacks into flank and rear areas are the same as for melee
combat.
</p>
<h6><a id="opponent-facing"></a>
Opponent Facing
</h6>
Not only does your facing matter when you�re attacking, but the facing of
your opponent does as well. If you�re attacking from a foe�s flank area
(or the squares beyond it, if you have a reach or ranged weapon), you get
a +2 bonus on the attack roll. You don�t
need anyone opposite you on the other side of your foe. If you�re
attacking from a foe�s rear area (or the squares beyond it), you get a +4
bonus on the attack roll.
<h6><a id="sneak-attacks"></a>
Sneak Attacks
</h6>
A rogue can strike for sneak attack damage whenever her foe is flat-footed
or whenever she�s attacking with a melee weapon from the foe�s rear area.
She doesn�t need anyone directly opposite her to get the extra damage. The
standard rules for creatures� immunity to sneak attack still apply. For
example, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersS.html#shambling-mound">shambling mound</a> has a rear area, but it�s immune to sneak
attack damage because it�s a plant. Conversely, a phasm doesn�t have a
front or rear, but you can still deal extra sneak attack damage if you
catch it flat-footed.
<p>
<img src="sneakAttacks.png" alt=
"Diagram: Sneak Attacks" width="360" height="280" />

Rogue A doesn�t get
to make sneak attacks against the gnoll, despite the presence of the
fighter on the other side of the foe. But both the fighter and rogue A get
a +2 bonus on their attacks because they�re standing in the gnoll�s flank
area.
</p>
<p>
Rogue B may make sneak attacks against the gnoll as long as she�s
attacking from one of the gnoll�s rear squares. If the gnoll turns to face
Rogue B, she�ll have to move if she wants to make sneak attacks.
</p>
<h5><a id="facing-and-perception"></a>
FACING AND PERCEPTION
</h5>
It�s much easier to see what�s going on in your front area, and much
easier to sneak around behind someone�s back.
<p><b><a id="spot-checks"></a>Spot Checks:</b>
Characters take a -5 penalty on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spot">Spot</a> checks to perceive things in their
flank area (or beyond) and a -10 penalty on Spot checks in their rear area
(or beyond). The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#combat-awareness">Combat Awareness</a> feat
eliminates this penalty. Faceless creatures (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="#faceless-creatures">see below</a>) and creatures with
all-around vision ability don�t take this penalty.
</p>
<p><b><a id="readied-actions"></a>Readied Actions:</b>
You can�t ready an action to respond to a trigger that occurs in your rear
area if you have to see it happen (such as a doorknob turning). But you
can ready an action for a sound-based trigger (such as the click of latch
opening).
</p>
<h5><a id="other-considerations"></a>
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
</h5>
The facing variant requires several other rule changes.
<h6><a id="faceless-creatures"></a>
Faceless Creatures
</h6>
Some creatures have no real facing because they can move, attack, and
perceive foes equally well in every direction. All <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#elemental">elementals</a>
and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#ooze">oozes</a>
are faceless. Also, the following monsters are faceless: <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersA.html#lantern-archon">lantern archon</a>,

and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersAnimal.html#octopus">octopus</a> (including giant octopus).
<p>
Faceless creatures can move or attack into any adjacent square, and they
can�t be flanked or attacked from the rear because they don�t have flanks
or rears.
</p>
<h6><a id="tiny-and-smaller-creatures"></a>
Tiny and Smaller Creatures
</h6>
Tiny and smaller creatures don�t have facing. They can move or attack in
any direction and are otherwise treated as faceless.
<h6><a id="feats-and-class-features"></a>
Feats and Class Features
</h6>
Some feats and class features provide an additional facing-related benefit
to characters who have them. Also, the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#combat-awareness">Combat Awareness</a> feat affects a
character�s awareness to his flanks and rear.
<p><b><a id="cleave-and-great-cleave"></a>Cleave and Great Cleave:</b>
The extra attacks granted by these feats can be made into flank areas
without penalty, as well as into front areas.</p>
<p><b><a id="combat-reflexes"></a>Combat Reflexes:</b>
Characters with this feat can make attacks of opportunity into their flank
areas without penalty.
</p>
<p><b><a id="improved-uncanny-dodge"></a>Improved Uncanny Dodge:</b>
No attacker gets the +2 bonus for attacking into your flank or the +4
bonus from attack from behind you. Only a rogue four levels higher than
you can deal sneak attack damage by attacking from a rear square.
</p>
<p><b><a id="mounted-combat"></a>Mounted Combat:</b>
Characters with this feat can attack into their steeds� flank areas
without penalty while mounted.
</p>
<p><b><a id="whirlwind-attack"></a>Whirlwind attack:</b>
Characters with this feat can attack into any area without penalty.
</p>

<h6><a id="spellcasting"></a>
Spellcasting
</h6>
Spells and spell-like abilities that have areas such as lines and cones
emerge from any grid intersection between the spellcaster�s space and his
front area. A spellcaster can�t target anything in his rear area with a
spell.
<h6><a id="flank-attacks"></a>
Flank Attacks
</h6>
Some monsters have attacks and abilities that reach flank squares as well
as front squares. These creatures take no penalty for making these attacks
into flank squares.

<h6><a id="shields-optional"></a>
Shields (Optional)
</h6>
If you�re particularly keen on facing, you
can add another layer of realism by modeling how shields only protect
against attacks from some directions. This "variant to a variant" system
introduces a shieldless AC for a character who is attacked from a
direction where he can�t interpose the shield between himself and the
threat. Shieldless AC is easy to figure: Just subtract the AC bonus the
shield provides (including its enhancement bonus if it�s a
magic shield) from the character�s normal AC.
<img src="shieldProtectionFig2.png" alt="" width=
"238" height="238" style="float:right" /> <img src=
"shieldProtectionFig1.png" alt="" width="238" height=
"238" style="float:right" />
<p>
A character holding a shield must indicate whether he�s wielding it to the
left or right. The shield only adds to the character�s AC against attacks
coming from his front area and the flank area on the shield�s side, plus
any squares that lie beyond those areas.
</p>
<p>
The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#shield">shield</a> spell provides a bonus to AC against attacks from the front
area only.
</p>
<h5><a id="combat-awareness"></a>
Combat Awareness [General]
</h5>
You are so perceptive that you practically have eyes in the back of your
head.
<p><b>Benefit:</b>
You take no -5 penalty on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spot">Spot</a> checks to notice things in or beyond your
flank areas. The penalty to notice things in or beyond your rear area is
-5.
</p>
<p><b>Normal:</b>
The penalty on Spot checks in or beyond your flank areas is -5; on Spot
checks in your rear area, it�s -10.
</p>
<p><b>Special:</b>
A fighter may select Combat Awareness as one of his fighter bonus feats.

<h3><a id="hex-grid"></a>HEX GRID</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Tactical affairs such as movement are best handled on a grid, but the grid
need not be a bunch of squares. This variant replaces the squares with
hexagons. (Hex grid paper and mats are available at many hobby stores.)
<p>
The primary advantage of this variant is that it eliminates the "every
other square counts double" rule for diagonal movement, because it
eliminates diagonal movement. Characters simply move from hex to adjacent
hex, changing direction as they like. To determine the distance between
two hexagons, just count hexes by the shorter path (in most cases, there
will be a number of equally short paths).
</p>
<p>
Using a hex-based grid changes relatively little about the game, but poses
a mapping dilemma for the GM. Most buildings and dungeons are based on
90-degree and 45-degree corners, so superimposing a hex-based grid on a
structure leaves the GM with many partial hexagons, not all of which are
big enough for a Medium creature. Use this variant only if you�re
comfortable adjucating these partial spaces on the fly.
</p>
<p>
Depending on their size, creatures take up one or more hexagons on the
grid, as shown in the accompanying diagram.
</p>
<img src="hexBasedCreatureSize.png" alt=
"Diagram: Hex-Based Creature Size" width="739" height="247" />
<p>
Spell areas change to accomodate the hex grid; refer to the diagram below.

<h5><a id="hexes-and-facing"></a>
HEXES AND FACING
</h5>
The hex-grid variant works well in conjunction with the facing variant,
giving your d20 game more of the feel of a tactical skirmish wargame. If
this suits your gaming group, use the diagram below to determine front,
flank, and rear areas according to the facing rules.
