<p class="initial">Miniatures are on the 30mm scale&#8212;a miniature

the battle grid is 1 inch across, representing a 5-foot-by-5-foot area.</p>
<a id="tactical-movement"></a><h5>TACTICAL MOVEMENT</h5>
<a id="how-far-can-your-character-move"></a><h6>How Far Can Your Character Move?</h6>
<p class="initial">Your speed is determined by your race and your
armor (see Table: Tactical Speed). Your speed while unarmored is your
base land speed.</p>
<a id="encumberance"></a><p><b>Encumbrance</b>: A character encumbered by carrying a large
amount of gear, treasure, or fallen comrades may move slower than
normal.</p>
<a id="hampered-movement"></a><p><b>Hampered Movement</b>: Difficult terrain, obstacles, or
poor visibility can hamper movement.</p>
<a id="movement-in-combat"></a><p><b>Movement in Combat</b>: Generally, you can move your speed
in a round and still do something (take a move action and a standard
action). If you do nothing but move (that is, if you use both of your
actions in a round to move your speed), you can move double your speed.
If you spend the entire round running, you can move quadruple your
speed. If you do something that requires a full round you can only take
a 5-foot step.</p>
<a id="bonuses-to-speed"></a><p><b>Bonuses to Speed</b>: A barbarian has a +10 foot bonus to
his speed (unless he&#8217;s wearing heavy armor). Experienced monks also
have higher speed (unless they&#8217;re wearing armor of any sort). In
addition, many spells and magic items can affect a character&#8217;s speed.
Always apply any modifiers to a character&#8217;s speed before adjusting the
character&#8217;s speed based on armor or encumbrance, and remember that
multiple bonuses of the same type to a character&#8217;s speed don&#8217;t stack.</p>

<a id="measuring-distance"></a><h6>Measuring Distance</h6>
<a id="diagonals"></a><p class="initial"><b>Diagonals</b>: When measuring distance, the
first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2 squares, the
third counts as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t move diagonally past a corner (even by taking a
5-foot step). You can move diagonally past a creature, even an
opponent. You can also move diagonally past other impassable obstacles,
such as pits.</p>
<a id="closest-creature"></a><p><b>Closest Creature</b>: When it&#8217;s important to determine the
closest square or creature to a location, if two squares or creatures
are equally close, randomly determine which one counts as closest by
rolling a die.</p>
<a id="moving-through-a-square"></a><h6>Moving through a Square</h6>
<a id="moving-through-a-square-friend"></a><p class="initial"><b>Friend</b>: You can move through a square
occupied by a friendly character, unless you are charging. When you
move through a square occupied by a friendly character, that character
doesn&#8217;t provide you with cover.</p>
<a id="moving-through-a-square-opponent"></a><p><b>Opponent</b>: You can&#8217;t move through a square occupied by
an opponent, unless the opponent is helpless. You can move through a
square occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty. (Some
creatures, particularly very large ones, may present an obstacle even
when helpless. In such cases, each square you move through counts as 2
squares.)</p>
<a id="ending-your-movement"></a><p><b>Ending Your Movement</b>: You can&#8217;t end your movement in
the same square as another creature unless it is helpless.</p>
<a id="overrun"></a><p><b>Overrun</b>: During your movement or as part of a charge,
you can attempt to move through a square occupied by an opponent.</p>
<a id="tumbling"></a><p><b>Tumbling</b>: A trained character can attempt to tumble
through a square occupied by an opponent (see the Tumble skill).</p>
<a id="very-small-creature"></a><p><b>Very Small Creature</b>: A Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny
creature can move into or through an occupied square. The creature
provokes attacks of opportunity when doing so.</p>
<a id="square-occupied-by-creature-three-sizes-larger-or-smaller"></a><p><b>Square Occupied by Creature Three Sizes Larger or Smaller</b>:
Any creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three
size categories larger than it is.</p>
<p>A big creature can move through a square occupied by a
creature three size categories smaller than it is.</p>
<a id="designated-exceptions"></a><p><b>Designated Exceptions</b>: Some creatures break the above
rules. A creature that completely fills the squares it occupies cannot
be moved past, even with the Tumble skill or similar special abilities.</p>
<a id="terrain-and-obstacles"></a><h6>Terrain and Obstacles</h6>
<p class="initial"><b>Difficult Terrain</b>: Difficult terrain
hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares
of movement. (Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts
as 3 squares.) You can&#8217;t run or charge across difficult terrain.</p>
<p>If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can
move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p>
<p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult
terrain.</p>
<a id="obstacles"></a><p><b>Obstacles</b>: Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper
movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn&#8217;t completely block
it each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2
squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the barrier, in
addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you
don&#8217;t have sufficient movement to cross the barrier and move into the
square on the other side, you can&#8217;t cross the barrier. Some obstacles
may also require a skill check to cross.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A
character can&#8217;t move through a blocking obstacle.</p>
<p>Flying and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles.</p>
<a id="squeezing"></a><p><b>Squeezing</b>: In some cases, you may have to squeeze into
or through an area that isn&#8217;t as wide as the space you take up. You can
squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your
normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it
were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space you take a &#8211;4
penalty on attack rolls and a &#8211;4 penalty to AC.</p>
<p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares)
squeezes into a space that&#8217;s one square wide, the creature&#8217;s miniature
figure occupies two squares, centered on the line between the two
squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the
area it squeezes into.</p>
<p>A creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it
can&#8217;t end its movement in an occupied square.</p>
<p>To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space&#8217;s
width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You can&#8217;t attack while
using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take
a &#8211;4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
<a id="special-movement-rules"></a><h6>Special Movement Rules</h6>
<p class="initial">These rules cover special movement situations.</p>
<a id="accidentally-ending-movement-in-an-illegal-space"></a><p><b>Accidentally Ending Movement in an Illegal Space</b>:
Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space
where it&#8217;s not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature
in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position,
if there&#8217;s a legal position that&#8217;s closer.</p>
<a id="double-movement-cost"></a><p><b>Double Movement Cost</b>: When your movement is hampered in
some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square
of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each
diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares (just as two
diagonal moves normally do).</p>
<p>If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as
4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is
doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if
diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two
doublings are equivalent to a tripling.</p>
<a id="minimum-movement"></a><p><b>Minimum Movement</b>: Despite penalties to movement, you
can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any
direction, even diagonally. (This rule doesn&#8217;t allow you to move
through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited.)
Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the
distance covered, this move isn&#8217;t a 5-foot step).</p>
<a id="big-and-little-creatures-in-combat"></a><h5>BIG AND LITTLE CREATURES IN COMBAT</h5>
<p class="initial">Creatures smaller than Small or larger than
Medium have special rules relating to position. </p>
<a id="tiny-diminutive-and-fine-creatures"></a><p><b>Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures</b>: Very small
creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more
than one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature
typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into
a single square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures
can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square
of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can&#8217;t
reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent&#8217;s square to
attack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the
opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you
can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach,
they do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them
without provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can&#8217;t flank an
enemy.</p>
<a id="large-huge-gargantuan-and-colossal-creatures"></a><p><b>Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures</b>: Very
large creatures take up more than 1 square.</p>
<p>Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a
natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets
even if they aren&#8217;t in adjacent squares.</p>
<p>Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with
greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens
squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural
reach usually gets an attack of opportunity against you if you approach
it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach
before you can attack it. (This attack of opportunity is not provoked
if you take a 5-foot step.)</p>
<p>Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to
double their natural reach but can&#8217;t strike at their natural reach or
less. </p>
