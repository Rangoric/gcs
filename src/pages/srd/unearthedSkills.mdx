With most skill
checks, a single die roll immediately determines whether or not a
character succeeds. If a character wants to jump across a chasm or recall
a specific piece of information, his success or failure is apparent after
a single check.
<p>
For complicated and time-consuming tasks (such as disabling a very complex
trap or researching an obscure bit of knowledge), or at times when the
game master wants to build tension and suspense, the complex skill check variant
described here might be called for. In such a case, a specific number of
successful skill checks must be achieved to complete the task. The
complexity of the task is reflected in the DC of the required check, the
number of successful rolls required to complete the task, and the maximum
number of failed rolls that can occur before the attempt fails. In most
cases, one or two failed rolls does not mean that a complex skill check
has failed, but if three failed rolls occur before the character makes the
required number of successful rolls, the attempt fails. Although three
failures is a common baseline, game masters are encouraged to change the
number if the situation warrants it.
</p>
<p>
The game master can also apply a penalty to future rolls in the complex
check if the character rolls one or more failures. For instance, an
intricate trade negotiation requiring a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check might
assess the character a -2 penalty on her checks for each failed check made
as part of the complex check (representing the tide of the negotiation
turning against her).

<p>
Each die roll is one portion of a complex skill check, and each die
roll in the attempt represents at least 1 round of effort (it might
represent more time, depending on the skill or task in question).
</p>
<p>
Like skill checks, ability checks can
also be complex.
</p>
<p>
Complex skill checks
are rarely used in situations that call for opposed checks.
</p>
<h5><a id="behind-the-curtains-how-many-successes"></a>
BEHIND THE CURTAIN: HOW MANY SuCCESSES?
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">
During play, the game master will encounter additional situations in which
complex skill checks may be appropriate. Two questions then arise: How high should the DC be,
and how many successes should the task require? The answers to both of
those questions depend on how great a chance of success the game master
wants the players to have.
<p>
Although making these determinations might seem daunting, the system for
complex skill checks actually provides the game master a great deal of flexibility. Under the
standard rules, game masters have only one tool to represent increasingly
difficult tasks: increasing the DC. With complex checks, the game master
can also use the number of successful attempts required to achieve overall
success to control a skill check's difficulty.
</p></div>
<h5><a id="trying-again"></a>
TRYING AGAIN
</h5>
Complex skill checks
can usually be retried. However, like normal skill checks, some complex
skill checks have consequences, and those consequences must be taken into
account. (For example, a trap that requires a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#disable-device">Disable Device</a> check
to disarm is triggered if the attempt fails, just as with a normal trap
and a normal Disable Device check.)
<p>
Some skills are virtually useless for a particular task once an attempt to
accomplish that task has failed, and this includes complex checks as well
as regular skill checks. The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-skill-use">Complex Skill Use</a> section, below, describes which skills
can be used in complex skill checks and which allow retries after failed
attempts.
</p>
<h5><a id="interrupting-a-complex-skill-check"></a>
INTERRUPTING A COMPLEX SKILL CHECK
</h5>
Most complex skill checks can be interrupted without adversely affecting the result of
the check. However, the game master is free to rule that interrupting a
specific check affects the result. At the game master's discretion, an
interruption can count as one failed roll in the check's progression or
can mean that the complex check fails.
<h5><a id="aid-another"></a>
AID ANOTHER
</h5>
You can use the aid another action normally with complex skill checks. Characters
aiding the character making the attempt must roll their aid another
attempts each time the character makes a new die roll that is part of the
complex skill check.
<h5><a id="taking-10-and-taking-20"></a>
TAKING 10 AND TAKING 20
</h5>
You can take 10 on a die roll during a complex skill check in any situation
when you could take to on a normal check using that skill.
<p>
You can't take 20 when making a complex skill check. Taking 20
represents making the same skill check repeatedly until you succeed, but
each successful die roll in a complex skill check represents only a
portion of the success you must achieve to complete the skill check.
</p>
<h5><a id="why-complex-checks"></a>
WHY COMPLEX CHECKS?
</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">
Complex skill checks
allow the game master to build suspense in critical situations, add
tension to multiple-round tasks during combat, enhance special
adventure-specific tasks, and resolve complex activities more quickly.
<p>
To build suspense with complex skill checks, the game
master can simply substitute a complex skill check for a normal skill
check during a critical task. In most such situations, using a complex
check lessens the likelihood that one failed roll will cause the party a
significant setback.
</p>
<p>
Complex skill checks
provide a more balanced way of creating combat-affecting situations that
depend on skill checks. For example, a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (architecture and
engineering) check made to find the weak spot in a narrow stone bridge
might allow the characters to collapse the bridge more easily and elude a
group of powerful pursuers.
</p>
<p>
Complex skill checks
can also enhance adventure-specific or location-specific tasks such as
disabling a particularly complex trap, appraising an extremely rare work
of art, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Complex skill checks
let players resolve complicated situations with fewer die rolls. This is
especially true of complex social interactions requiring multiple <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a>,
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks.

<p>
In most situations when the game master feels a complex skill check is warranted,
it's appropriate for the DC of a complex skill check to match the DC of a
simple check involving the same activity. This decreases the character's
chance of achieving overall success, but because complex skill checks are
used to best effect in tense situations and climactic encounters,
increasing the difficulty adds spice to the scenario.
</p>
<p>
Increasing the number of successes required always increases the
difficulty of the task, but the degree of increase depends greatly on how
likely the character attempting the check is to get a success each time he
rolls the die.
</p>
<p>
For example, Freeble has a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#disable-device">Disable Device</a> modifier of +14 and he
encounters a trap with a DC of 25. Under the normal rules, Freeble has a
50-50 chance of successfully disarming the trap (because half of the
possible results on a d20 are 11 or higher, granting her a success). If
the trap requires a complex check to disarm, however, these odds can
change. If succeeding on the complex check requires a certain number of
successful die rolls before the same number of failures are recorded,
Freeble's chance of overall success is essentially unchanged, but if the
trap requires more successes to disarm than the number of failures
required to fail the complex check, the chance of overall success drops.
The more difficult it is for the character to meet or exceed the DC, the
more pronounced the difference. If in the above example Freeble had a
Disable Device modifier of +9 (meaning that he has to roll a 16 or higher
to get a success), increasing the number of required successes reduces the
chance of overall success much more rapidly.
</p>
<p>
To determine the likelihood of overall success on a given complex skill check, compare the
number that the character must roll on a d20 (obtained by subtracting the
character's skill modifier from the check's DC) to the number of successes
on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-chance-for-success">Table: Chance for Success</a>. By using this table to guide the choice of
DC and number of successes, the game master can give two checks with an
equal likelihood of success vastly different flavors.
</p></div>
<h5><a id="complex-skill-use"></a>
COMPLEX SKILL USE
</h5>
The following section provides general guidelines for using the complex
skill check variant with each skill in the d20 game system.
<h6><a id="complex-appraise"></a>
Appraise
</h6>
<p>
The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#appraise">Appraise</a> skill seldom lends itself to complex skill checks. In rare cases,
the game master might rule that a relic from a lost civilization or an
extremely powerful magic item might require a complex skill check to
appraise properly. In these cases, the DC and number of successes required
should be determined by the game master specifically for the item in
question.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if an item has a common value that is accepted in most of
the campaign world but a drastically different value in one small portion
of the setting, it might require one simple check to appraise the item's
common value and a second, complex check (usually at a higher DC) to
assess the item's worth in the specific area.
</p>
<h6><a id="complex-balance"></a>
Balance
</h6>
Since one <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#balance">Balance</a> check covers movement over a short distance, using the
skill does not lend itself to complex skill checks. Situations
that call for multiple Balance checks always require multiple simple
checks, not one complex check.

<h6><a id="complex-bluff"></a>
Bluff
</h6>
Almost all uses of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a> skill require only a single roll to indicate
whether or not you successfully fool an individual or a small group.
However, in certain complicated social situations, a game master might
want to speed the game along by requiring one complex Bluff check rather
than many simple checks.
<p>
For example, one of the characters wants to spend several days in a
noble's court trying to convince the people there that he and his
adventuring companions are more capable than they really are. Rather than
roleplay the many individual interactions, the game master decides to
simulate this activity with a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#bluff">Bluff</a> check. Because the nobles have
heard little of the group's exploits, the game master sets the DC at 25
and requires that the player achieve five successful rolls before rolling
three failures. Although this is a good simulation of the character
interacting with a series of minor NPCs over several days, the game master
still decides that interactions with a few individuals (the duke, his
chancellor, and one renowned knight in the duke's service) are too
important to incorporate into the complex check, and decides that the
player should roleplay short encounters with each of the three and make
separate, simple Bluff checks for each of them.
</p>
<h6><a id="complex-climb"></a>
Climb
</h6>
Because one <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#climb">Climb</a> check covers movement over a short distance, using the
skill does not lend itself to complex skill checks. Situations
that call for multiple Climb checks always require multiple simple checks,
not one complex check.

<h6><a id="complex-concentration"></a>
Concentration
</h6>
Typical use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#concentration">Concentration</a> skill never requires a complex
skill check, but special
circumstances might require complex checks as determined by the game
master.
<p>
For example, the entrance to an enchanter's laboratory might be magically
enhanced with mental barriers to entry and require a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#concentration">Concentration</a>
check to pass through.
</p>
<h6><a id="complex-craft"></a>
Craft
</h6>
Normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#craft">Craft</a> skill in many ways resembles a complex
skill check, though it
penalizes the character on each failure (rather than only after three
failures).
<p>
You can replace the standard <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#craft">Craft</a> check rules with a complex Craft check.
In that case, a single failed check doesn't ruin one third of the raw
materials; instead, rolling three failures before achieving the requisite
number of successes ruins one third of the raw materials, requiring the
character to start over. Each check represents a single day (if the item's
value is no more than 1 gp) or a full week (if the item's value is higher
than 1 gp) of work.

<h6><a id="complex-decipher-script"></a>
Decipher Script
</h6>
Complicated books, convoluted essays, or coded documents might require a
complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#decipher-script">Decipher Script</a> check. When a character attempts to decipher an
extremely long document, the game master can require one complex skill check rather than a
simple skill check for each page. The DCs for complex checks follow the
same guidelines that normal Decipher Script checks follow (DC 20 for
simple messages, DC 25 for standard texts, and DC 30 or higher for
intricate, exotic, or very old writing). Succeeding on the complex check
requires that the character achieve one successful attempt for every ten
pages of the manuscript before failing the check three times.
<h6><a id="complex-diplomacy"></a>
Diplomacy
</h6>
Although typical use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> skill does not allow retries or lend
itself to complex skill
checks, a game master might choose to simulate an unusually long
diplomatic session or interactions with multiple small groups for an
extended period of time with one complex Diplomacy check.
<p>
For example, a character wants to convince a large and fractious group of
merchants to suspend travel through a dangerous area for a short amount of
time so that he and his companions can adventure in the area and confront
the monsters there without exposing innocent travelers to danger. Instead
of rolling thirty or more <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks and roleplaying the reaction of
each merchant in the group, the game master uses one complex skill check with a DC of 30
(representing the extreme difficulty of getting all the quarrelsome
merchants to agree) that requires five successes before rolling three
failures. The game master also might rule that because the tide of opinion
can turn against the character very quickly in this case, each failed roil
applies a cumulative 2 penalty to further rolls in the complex skill
check.
</p>
<h6><a id="complex-disable-device"></a>
Disable Device
</h6>
Nearly any trap can be made to require a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#disable-device">Disable Device</a> check
rather than a simple one. If the trap requires a large number of successes
(six or more) or if the attempt is ruined by less than three failures,
adjust the Challenge Rating of the trap up by 1 or 2 to reflect the
greater difficulty of disarming the trap.
<p>
A trap that requires a complex skill check may have a
higher cost and Challenge Rating than a trap of the same sort that only
requires a simple check; see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-complex-disable-device-checks">Table: Complex Disable Device Checks</a>. See the
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="traps.html#mechanical-trap-cost">standard rules for trap

<h6><a id="complex-disguise"></a>
Disguise
</h6>
Although typical use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#disguise">Disguise</a> skill does not allow retries or lend
itself to complex skill checks, game masters might require that the disguised character make a
complex Disguise check in the same complicated social situations that
require a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-bluff">Bluff</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-intimidate">Intimidate</a> check.
<h6><a id="complex-escape-artist"></a>
Escape Artist
</h6>
Although normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> skill does not lend itself to
complex skill
checks, a few specific environmental situations might call for a
complex Escape Artist check. The most obvious of these and by far the most
common is a long, extremely narrow passage that is only wide enough to let
a character wiggle through. In this case, each successful roll made in the
complex check represents navigating a portion of the passage, and a failed
complex check means the character is stuck somewhere within the passage.
<h6><a id="complex-forgery"></a>
Forgery
</h6>
As with <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-disguise">Disguise</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#forgery">this skill</a> rarely lends itself to complex checks, but in
unusual situations where a forged document must go through the hands of
several individuals, the game master might substitute a complex check for
a simple Forgery check.
<h6><a id="complex-gather-information"></a>
Gather Information
</h6>
Typically, the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#gather-information">Gather Information</a> skill allows characters to get a general
impression of major news items in a city or to find the answer to a
specific question or information about a specific rumor. As long as the
character has only a few questions or rumors to follow up on, a simple
skill check should
be used. In situations where the characters have half a dozen or more
leads and questions to follow, the game master might want to use one
complex skill check to resolve the information-gathering attempts. In this
case, the number of successes required equals the number of questions or
leads pursued, and the game master determines the number of failures that
ruin the complex check.
<p>
In a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#gather-information">Gather information</a> check, each die roll represents 2 hours
spent pursuing each individual question or lead.
</p>

<h6><a id="complex-handle-animal"></a>
Handle Animal
</h6>
Complex skill checks
work well with the extended training times that some uses of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#handle-animal">Handle
Animal</a> skill require. When an animal is trained for a general purpose such
as combat riding or hunting, it requires several weeks of work and one
simple Handle Animal check under the normal rules. With the complex skill
checks variant, this use of the skill always involves a complex skill
check, with each die roll representing one week of training time. Rolling
three failed results during the complex check means that the entire
attempt fails and that training must begin again.

<h6><a id="complex-heal"></a>
Heal
</h6>
Although normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill does not lend itself to complex
skill checks, game
masters are free to require complex skill checks to treat particularly
virulent strains of a disease or especially effective mixes of certain
poisons.
<h6><a id="complex-hide"></a>
Hide
</h6>
Normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#hide">Hide</a> skill does not lend itself to complex
skill checks. In certain
unusual situations, a game master might use a complex skill check to
simulate navigating an intricate environment such as an urban area while
remaining unnoticed (this might mean blending in rather than remaining
entirely out of sight in particularly crowded areas). For example, if a
character wants to move from one place to another within a large city
without being seen by members of the city watch, the game master might use
a complex skill check to simulate the character's progress without having
to determine the location of every guard or roleplaying each encounter.
<h6><a id="complex-intimidate"></a>
Intimidate
</h6>
Although typical use of the intimidate skill does not allow retries or
lend itself to complex skill checks, a game master
might choose to simulate an unusually complicated series of social
encounters with one complex skill check in the same way that <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-bluff">Bluff</a> and
<a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> can be used in such situations.
<h6><a id="complex-jump"></a>
Jump
</h6>
Since one <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#jump">Jump</a> check represents one jump attempt, using the skill does not
lend itself to complex skill checks. Situations
that call for multiple jump checks always require multiple simple checks,
not one complex check.
<h6><a id="complex-knowledge"></a>
Knowledge
</h6>
Researching rare or lost knowledge is an excellent use of the complex
skill check variant.
<p>
To attempt a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> check, a character must have access to a
library that the game master decides is sufficient for the task. The game
master is also free to rule that several successful rolls in a complex
Knowledge check exhaust a particular library or tome's resources and lead
the character to another work or library. In this way, a complex Knowledge
check can become an adventure in itself as the character searches out rare
or lost volumes of information.

<h6><a id="complex-listen"></a>
Listen
</h6>
Since one <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#listen">Listen</a> check represents one attempt to hear something, using the
skill does not lend itself to complex skill checks. Situations
that call for multiple Listen checks always require multiple simple
checks, not one complex check.
<h6><a id="complex-move-silently"></a>
Move Silently
</h6>
Using the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#move-silently">Move Silently</a> skill does not normally lend itself to complex
skill checks, but a
complex check can be used to simulate an unusually long period of moving
silently in the same way that a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-hide">Hide</a> check might be used.

<h6><a id="complex-open-lock"></a>
Open Lock
</h6>
Although normal locks require only one <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#open-lock">Open Lock</a> check, the game master is
free to include locks or a series of locks that requires a complex check
to open. (He can also rule that each casting of a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoL.html#knock">knock</a> spell counts as
six successes toward opening a complex lock.) Particulars for complex
locks are given in this table:

<h6><a id="complex-perform"></a>
Perform
</h6>
Normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#perform">Perform</a> skill does not lend itself to complex
skill checks. At the game
master's discretion, a few rare and powerful magic instruments might
require a complex Perform check to activate.
<h6><a id="complex-profession"></a>
Profession
</h6>
Because each <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#profession">Profession</a> check already represents a week of work, the use
of the Profession skill does not lend itself to complex skill checks.
<h6><a id="complex-ride"></a>
Ride
</h6>
Normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#ride">Ride</a> skill does not lend itself to complex
skill checks. A character
performing a lengthy demonstration of difficult or trick riding, or
competing in a race, might have to make a complex Ride check to pull off
the entire show or finish the race; one roll per round is probably
appropriate.
<h6><a id="complex-search"></a>
Search
</h6>
At the game master's discretion, certain very well-hidden items might
require a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#search">Search</a> check to find. Usually this activity represents
several individual Search attempts made in sequence and is typically
better handled by treating each separate attempt as a normal Search check.

<h6><a id="complex-sense-motive"></a>
Sense Motive
</h6>
Although typical use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> skill does not allow retries or
lend itself to complex skill checks, a game master
might choose to simulate an unusually complicated series of social
encounters in a deceit-filled environment with a complex skill check like
those described under the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-bluff">Bluff</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#complex-diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> descriptions.
<h6><a id="complex-sleight-of-hand"></a>
Sleight of Hand
</h6>
Normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> skill does not lend itself to complex
skill checks. A character performing a lengthy demonstration of legerdemain (such as a
magic show relying on sleight of hand) might have to make a complex
Sleight of Hand check to pull off the entire show, one roll per 15 minutes
is probably appropriate.
<h6><a id="complex-spellcraft"></a>
Spellcraft
</h6>
Although use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> skill does not normally lend itself to
complex skill
checks, the game master is free to rule that examining a complicated
magical effect might require a complex Spellcraft check.
<h6><a id="complex-spot"></a>
Spot
</h6>
Since one <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spot">Spot</a> check represents one attempt to notice something, using the
skill does not lend itself to complex skill checks.
Situations that call for multiple Spot checks always require multiple
simple checks, not one complex check.
<h6><a id="complex-survival"></a>
Survival
</h6>
The game master might rule that a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#survival">Survival</a> check allows long-term
survival in one type of climate or terrain, raising the required number of
successes for extreme environments such as arctic regions or deserts.
<h6><a id="complex-swim"></a>
Swim
</h6>
The game master might rule that a complex <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#swim">Swim</a> check allows a character to
successfully swim for a longer period of time than I round. The amount of
time each successful complex skill check allows the
character to swim, along with the required number of successes and the DC,
is given in <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-complex-swim-checks">Table: Complex Swim Checks</a>. (The DC is slightly higher than
for simple round-by-round checks to reflect the fact that the character is
making many fewer checks.)

<h6><a id="complex-tumble"></a>
Tumble
</h6>
Normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#tumble">Tumble</a> skill does not lend itself to complex skill checks. A character
performing a lengthy routine of acrobatics might have to make a complex
Tumble check to pull off the entire show. The frequency of the checks
depends on the complexity of the routine.
<h6><a id="complex-use-magic-device"></a>
Use Magic Device
</h6>
Normal use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#use-magic-device">Use Magic Device</a> skill does not lend itself to complex
skill checks.
However, when a character makes a check to activate a magic item
(especially a complicated one, or one with several different functions)
for the first time, the game master might find a complex skill check
appropriate. In very special cases, this check might require a full round
of concentration per roll, but it should usually be part of the action
required to activate the item.
<h6><a id="complex-use-rope"></a>
Use Rope
</h6>
Since one <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#use-rope">Use Rope</a> check represents one attempt to manipulate a rope,
using the skill does not lend itself to complex skill checks. Situations
that call for multiple Use Rope checks always require multiple simple
checks, not one complex check.
