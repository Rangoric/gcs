This variant eliminates hit\npoints, and simply determines whether characters are hurt or killed every\ntime they�re hit in combat.\n    <h5><a id=\"determining-injuries\"></a>\nDETERMINING INJURIES\n    </h5>\nWhen using the injury variant, characters no longer have hit points.\nInstead, a character�s injuries accumulate until he becomes <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#disabled\">disabled</a> or\n    <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#dying\">dying</a> (or <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#staggered\">staggered</a> or <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#unconscious\">unconscious</a>, if he has taken nonlethal damage).\n    <p>\nWhen a character or creature takes damage, divide the damage dealt by the\nattack by 5 (rounding up). The result is the damage value of the attack.\nFor example, if you are hit by an attack that deals 12 points of damage,\nthe attack has a damage value of 3 (12 divided by 5, rounded up).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTo determine if you are injured, make a Fortitude save to resist\ninjury. The DC is 15 + the damage value.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf you succeed on the save, you suffer no ill effect from the attack.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf you fail the save by less than 10, you have taken a hit. (If the attack\ndealt nonlethal damage, the hit is a nonlethal hit.) Each hit you take\nimposes a cumulative -1 modifier on future Fortitude saves to resist\ninjury.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf you fail the save by 10 or more, you are <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#disabled\">disabled</a>.

This capacity, measured as reserve points, replenishes lost hit\npoints quickly after a fight. Thus, characters may be wounded and near\ndeath by the end of a fight, but then recover to full strength (or nearly\nfull strength) before the next fight begins.\n    <p>\nReserve points work particularly well in low-magic campaigns or any game\nin which healing is rare, expensive, or otherwise hard to get.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"behind-the-curtain-reserve-points\"></a>\nBEHIND THE CURTAIN: RESERVE POINTS\n    </h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>Even though this variant effectively doubles a character�s number of hit\npoints, he can�t take a beating over and over again without depleting his\ncapacity to recover.

Thus, for each minute of nonstrenuous activity, the\ncharacter regains 1 hit point and loses 1 reserve point.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor example, Kroh has 22 hit points, so he also has 22 reserve points. In\na battle with orcs, he takes 6 points of damage, dropping his hit points\nto 16. After the fight, Kroh�s reserve points begin to \"convert\" to hit\npoints. Over the course of the next 6 minutes, his reserve point total\ndrops by 6 and his hit point total increases by 6, up to his maximum of\n22. During the next fight, Kroh takes 24 points of damage, dropping him to\n-2, and then is dying for 5 rounds before stabilizing, leaving him at -7\nhit points. Over the next 16 minutes his remaining 16 reserve points\nconvert to hit points. After 7 minutes he�s conscious but disabled (0 hp).\nAfter 8 minutes he�s back on his feet (1 hp), and after all 16 minutes\nhe�s up to 9 hit points and 0 reserve points.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"nonlethal-damage-and-reserve-points\"></a>Nonlethal damage:</b>\nReserve points can also reduce a character�s nonlethal damage total. For\neach reserve point that converts to a hit point, a character also\nsubtracts 1 point from his nonlethal damage. In addition, a character can\ntake astandard\naction to \"spend\" a number of reserve points equal to or less than his\nHD to reduce his nonlethal damage an equal amount. (If a character has the\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#endurance\">Endurance</a> feat, the GM might choose to make this a move action, to reflect\nthe fact that such characters can more easily perservere through\nexhausting situations.)\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"replenishing-reserve-points\"></a>\nREPLENISHING RESERVE POINTS\n    </h5>\nCharacters naturally regain lost reserve points at the same rate that they\nnaturally heal lost hit points. If a character receives any magical healing, that healing\nis applied first to the character�s lost hit points. Any excess healing\nleft over after the character�s hit points are restored to full normal is\napplied to increase the character�s current reserve point total (up to its\nnormal maximum).\n    <p>\nFor example, Kroh normally has 22 hit points, but he�s down to 9 hp and 0\nreserve points. He drinks a potion of cure moderate wounds, rolling 2d8 +\n3 and getting a result of 15. The first 13 points replenish his hit\npoints; the remainder go to his reserve points. He now has 22 hit points\nand 2 reserve points.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"constitution-changes\"></a>\nCONSTITUTION CHANGES\n    </h5>\nIf a character�s Constitution modifier goes up or down, his reserve points\ngo up or down just as his hit points do. If a decrease in Constitution\nwould drop a character�s reserve points below 0, any excess reduction is\ndeducted from his current hit points.\n    <h3><a id=\"massive-damage-thresholds-and-results\"></a>MASSIVE DAMAGE THRESHOLDS AND RESULTS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\nThe massive\ndamage rule is designed for games of heroic fantasy. It maintains the\nremote possibility that a single blow from a mighty opponent can kill a\ncharacter, regardless of that character�s actual hit points.\n    <p>\nAltering the massive damage rules can dramatically change the character�s\nattitude about combat. A lower threshold (the amount of damage that\ntriggers a Fortitude\nsave to avoid death) makes combat more deadly, perhaps turning any hit\ninto a potentially life-threatening injury. On the other hand, a less\ndeadly result on a failed save (<a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious\">unconsciousness</a> instead of death, for\ninstance) makes combat less dangerous, making a character�s current hit\npoint total more important than any single hit.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nHere, then, are several alternative massive damage thresholds and results.\nYou can combine different variants to create your own custom system. For\ninstance, you might combine the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#hd-based-threshold\">HD-based threshold</a> variant with the\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#size-based-threshold\">size-based threshold</a> variant to create a massive damage threshold that\ntakes into account both a creature�s Hit Dice and size.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nRegardless of the variant you use, each player should record his\ncharacter�s massive damage threshold somewhere on the character sheet (to\navoid mid-battle calculations), and the GM might want to add massive\ndamage threshold values to monster and NPC statistics blocks for the same\nreason.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"alternative-threshold-levels\"></a>\nALTERNATIVE THRESHOLD LEVELS\n    </h5>\nThe 50-point threshold in the standard d20 rules can be altered in several\nways.\n    <p><b><a id=\"consitution-based-threshold\"></a>Constitution-Based Threshold:</b>\nA character�s massive damage threshold is equal to his Constitution score. Whenever he takes damage\nfrom a single hit that equals or exceeds his current Constitution score,\nhe must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or suffer\nthe effects of massive damage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf an attack deals hit point damage and also changes the character�s\nConstitution score (such as a strike with a poisoned weapon), apply all\neffects of the hit before determining whether the damage is enough to\ntrigger the saving\nthrow. For instance, a character with a 14 Constitution is hit by a\ngreatsword coated with <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#black-adders-venom\">black adder venom</a>. The attack deals 12 points of\ndamage, but the character also fails his Fortitude save against\nthe poison and takes 3 points of Constitution damage. This lowers his\nConstitution � and hence his massive damage threshold � to 11. Since the\ndamage exceeds the threshold, the character must now make a Fortitude save\nto avoid the effect of massive damage.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"hd-based-threshold\"></a>HD-Based Threshold:</b>\nA character�s massive damage threshold is equal to 25, +2 per Hit Die.\nWhenever a character takes damage from a single hit that equals or exceeds\nthis value, he must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or suffer\nthe effects of massive damage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor example, a 5th-level human fighter has a massive damage threshold of\n35 (25 + [2 � 5]). A fire giant\nhas a massive damage threshold of 55 (25\n+ [2 � 15]).\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"size-based-threshold\"></a>Size-Based Threshold:</b>\nA creature�s massive damage threshold is equal to 50, plus or minus 10\npoints for every size category larger or smaller than Medium.

The character becomes <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying\">dying</a> and <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious\">unconscious</a>, but can still\nbecome <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#stable\">stable</a> or be helped by his friends, just like any other character\nwho is reduced to -1 hp.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"near-death-result\"></a>Near-Death Result:</b>\nAlternatively, instead of a failed Fortitude save against\nmassive damage resulting in instant death, a failed save results in a\ncharacter being reduced to -8 hp. The character is very close to death\n(having only a round or two to become <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#stable\">stable</a> or receive help), but isn�t\nautomatically killed.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"variable-result\"></a>Variable Result:</b>\nFor an added bit of random chance, a character who fails his Fortitude save against\nmassive damage rolls 1d10 to determine his negative hit point total. A\nroll of 1 to 9 indicates that the character is <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying\">dying</a> (at -1 hp on a 1, -2\nhp on a 2, and so forth). A roll of 10 leaves the character with -10 hit\npoints, which means he is <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead\">dead</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"scaling-the-saving-throw\"></a>\nSCALING THE SAVING THROW\n    </h5>\nAnother way to tweak the massive damage system\nis to scale the Fortitude save DC based\non the damage taken. For every 10 points of damage dealt by an attack in\nexcess of a character�s massive damage threschold, increase his Fortitude\nsave DC by 2. This rule functions the same regardless of the threshold you\nchoose to use.\n    <p>\nFor instance, if you use the standard 50-point threshold, a hit that deals\n50 to 59 points of damage requires a DC 15 save, 60 to 69 points DC 17, 70\nto 79 points DC 19, and so forth. If you use the Constitution-based\nthreshold, a character with a Constitution of 15 would have to make a DC\n15 Fortitude save\nwhen taking 15 to 24 points from a single attack, DC 17 for 25 to 34\npoints, DC 19 for 35 to 44 points, and so on.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"combining-massive-damage-variants\"></a>\nCOMBINING MASSIVE DAMAGE VARIANTS\n    </h5>\nThe massive\ndamage variants given above can be combined in a number of ways.\n    <p>\nTo combine the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#constitution-based-threshold\">Constitution-based threshold</a> variant with the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#hd-based-threshold\">HD-based\nsystem</a>, simply use a character�s Constitution score instead of 25 to\ndetermine a character�s massive damage threshold. For example, a 3rd-level\ncharacter with a Constitution of 14 has a massive damage threshold of 20\n(14 + [3 � 2]). In most cases, this calculation results in a threshold\nlower than the HD-based threshold but still higher than the\nConstitution-based threshold � retaining the \"grittiness\" of the\nConstitution-based system for low-to mid-level characters, while allowing\nhigher-level characters to become braver in combat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nYou can easily combine the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#hd-based-threshold\">HD-based system</a> with the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#size-based-threshold\">size-based variant</a>:\nUse half of the base value for size instead of 20 to determine the massive\ndamage threshold.

But they can also bounce back\nfrom a fight much more quickly. For that reason, this variant is an ideal\nsystem for low-magic campaigns or games where healing is otherwise rare.\n      <p>\nA very weak creature in this system tends to be tougher to kill than in a\nstandard d20 game, since its Constitution score is often higher than the\nnumber of hit points it might have had. Very big creatures are also more\ndurable, due to their size\nmodifier. This is reflected in the CR adjustments given in the variant\nrules.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nCreatures capable of dealing a large amount of damage on a single hit\nbecome significantly more deadly in this system, since a lucky attack roll can give a\ndeadly blow to almost any character. For critical hits, consider reducing\nthe additional damage from bonus damage dice (such as a flaming sword or a\nrogue�s sneak attack) to only 1 point per die. (Such attacks deal normal\ndamage on noncritical hits.) That�s still pretty scary when fighting a\nhigh-level rogue, but not quite as terrifying as facing the possibility of\nan extra 5 or 10 dice of wound point damage with a successful sneak attack\ncritical hit. You may find other places where damage needs adjustment in\nthis system as well; don�t be afraid to tinker when needed to keep your\ngame fun and exciting.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nConstitution damage is especially deadly under this variant, since every\npoint of Constitution damage reduces wound points by 1 and every 2 points\nof damage reduces vitality by a number of points equal to the character�s\nHD.

Like hit\npoints in the standard d20 rules, vitality points go up with level, giving\nhigh-level characters more ability to shrug off attacks. Most types of\ndamage reduce vitality points.\n    <p>\nCharacters gain vitality points as they gain levels. Just as with hit\npoints in the standard d20 rules, at each level a character rolls a\nvitality die and adds his Constitution modifier, adding the total to his\nvitality point total.

The NPC\nclasses � adept, aristocrat, commoner, expert and warrior � grant no vitality\npoints (either at 1st level or thereafter). Such characters have wound\npoints equal to their Constitution score. Thus, a typical 1st-level orc\nwarrior has no vitality points and 12 wound points. All damage dealt to\nsuch creatures is applied to their wound points.\n    <p>\nMost monsters, on the other hand, have both wound points and vitality\npoints. For Small, Medium and Large creatures, a monster�s wound point\ntotal is equal to its current Constitution score.
