Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff\nis hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes\nagainst its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If\nit&rsquo;s important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails\nbecause\nthe target doesn&rsquo;t believe it and one that fails because it just\nasks\ntoo much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on\nits Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and\nthe Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target\ndidn&rsquo;t\nso much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A\ntarget that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.</p>\n    <p>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as\nyou wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or\nbelieves something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not\na suggestion spell. </p>\n    <p>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target.\nCreatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p>\n    <a id=\"feinting-in-combat\"></a><p><i>Feinting in Combat</i>: You can also use Bluff to mislead\nan opponent in melee combat (so that it can&rsquo;t dodge your next\nattack\neffectively).

If your Bluff check result exceeds this special\nSense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to\nAC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack\nmust be made on or before your next turn.</p>\n    <p>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult\nbecause it&rsquo;s harder to read a strange creature&rsquo;s body\nlanguage; you\ntake a &ndash;4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of\nanimal\nIntelligence (1 or 2) it&rsquo;s even harder; you take a &ndash;8\npenalty. Against\na nonintelligent creature, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>\n    <p>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n    <a id=\"creating-a-diversion-to-hide\"></a><p><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use the Bluff\nskill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the\nmomentary diversion you need to attempt a <a href=\"#hide\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Hide</a> check while people are\naware of you.

Failure\nby 4 or less means you can&rsquo;t get the message across. Failure by 5\nor\nmore means that some false information has been implied or inferred.\nAnyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed\nby the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your\nmessage (see Sense Motive).</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general\ninteraction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round\naction), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A\nBluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a\nstandard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message\ndoesn&rsquo;t\ntake an action; it is part of normal communication.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in\nsocial interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again\nin the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks\nmade to feint in combat.

Such actions include casting a spell,\nconcentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like\nability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity.\nIn general, if an action wouldn&rsquo;t normally provoke an attack of\nopportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being\ndistracted.</p>\n    <p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the\naction as normal.

If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends\nas if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a\nspell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were\nusing a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill\nuse also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other\nramifications as well.</p>\n    <p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that\ncause you to make a Concentration check.

You could have several Craft\nskills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.</p>\n    <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something.\nIf nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the\nheading of a Profession skill.</p>\n    <p><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent\nliving, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of\ndedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to\nperform the craft&rsquo;s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained\nhelpers,\nand how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants\nearn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>\n    <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow\nyou to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the\ncomplexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and\nthe price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular\nitem. The item&rsquo;s finished price also determines the cost of raw\nmaterials.</p>\n    <p>In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the\nresults of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you\nmust make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make\narticles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>\n    <p>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction\nwith the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items\nthat have the strength of steel.</p>\n    <p>When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an\nappropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>\n    <p>All crafts require artisan&rsquo;s tools to give the best\nchance of\nsuccess. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a\n&ndash;2\ncircumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan&rsquo;s\ntools\nprovide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>\n    <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item,\nfollow these steps.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Find the item&rsquo;s price. Put the price in silver pieces\n(1 gp\n= 10 sp).</li>\n      <li>Find the DC from the table below.</li>\n      <li>Pay one-third of the item&rsquo;s price for the cost of raw\nmaterials.</li>\n      <li>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one\nweek&rsquo;s\nwork. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If\nthe result &times; the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you\nhave completed the item. (If the result &times; the DC equals double or\ntriple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you&rsquo;ve\ncompleted\nthe task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the\nDC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result &times; the DC\ndoesn&rsquo;t equal the price, then it represents the progress\nyou&rsquo;ve made\nthis week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next\nweek. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the\nprice of the item in silver pieces.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this\nweek.</p>\n    <p>If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and\nhave to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>\n    <a id=\"craft-progress-by-the-day\"></a><p><i>Progress by the Day</i>: You can make checks by the day\ninstead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result\n&times; DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.</p>\n    <a id=\"creating-masterwork-items\"></a><p><i>Creating Masterwork Items</i>: You can make a masterwork\nitem&mdash;a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a\nbonus on\nits use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being\nmagical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork\ncomponent as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard\nitem. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon\nor 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20.

This usage does not take an action.</p>\n    <a id=\"fight-with-warhorse\"></a><p><i>Fight with Warhorse</i>: If you direct your war-trained\nmount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or\nattacks normally. This usage is a free action.</p>\n    <a id=\"cover\"></a><p><i>Cover</i>: You can react instantly to drop down and hang\nalongside your mount, using it as cover. You can&rsquo;t attack or cast\nspells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check,\nyou don&rsquo;t get the cover benefit.

If you fail your Ride\ncheck, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate\nfalling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an\naction, but is part of the mount&rsquo;s movement.</p>\n    <a id=\"spur-mount\"></a><p><i>Spur Mount</i>: You can spur your mount to greater speed\nwith a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount&rsquo;s\nspeed\nby 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You\ncan use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of\nadditional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the\nprevious round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).</p>\n    <a id=\"control-mount-in-battle\"></a><p><i>Control Mount in Battle</i>: As a move action, you can\nattempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not\ntrained for combat riding while in battle.

The DCs for various tasks\ninvolving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-use-magic-device\"></a><table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"150px\"\n          }}>Task</th>\n          <th>Use Magic Device DC</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Activate blindly</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">25</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Decipher a written spell</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">25 + spell level</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Use a scroll</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">20 + caster level</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Use a wand</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">20</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Emulate a class feature</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">20</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Emulate an ability score</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">See text</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Emulate a race</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">25</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Emulate an alignment</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\" align=\"center\">30</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <a id=\"activate-blindly\"></a><p><i>Activate Blindly</i>: Some magic items are activated by\nspecial words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as\nif you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when\nyou&rsquo;re not and even if you don&rsquo;t know it. You do have to\nperform some\nequivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must\nspeak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to\nactivate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if\nyou&rsquo;ve activated the item in question at least once before. If\nyou fail\nby 9 or less, you can&rsquo;t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or\nmore,\nyou suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released\nbut it doesn&rsquo;t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps\nare\nthat the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical\nenergy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is\nin addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you\ncast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.</p>\n    <a id=\"decipher-a-written-spell\"></a><p><i>Decipher a Written Spell</i>: This usage works just like\ndeciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the\nDC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of\nconcentration.</p>\n    <a id=\"emulate-an-ability-score\"></a><p><i>Emulate an Ability Score</i>: To cast a spell from a\nscroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence\nfor wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer\nor bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class\nyou&rsquo;re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll)\nis\nyour Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high\nenough score in the appropriate ability, you don&rsquo;t need to make\nthis\ncheck.</p>\n    <a id=\"emulate-an-alignment\"></a><p><i>Emulate an Alignment</i>: Some magic items have positive or\nnegative effects based on the user&rsquo;s alignment. Use Magic Device\nlets\nyou use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You\ncan emulate only one alignment at a time.</p>\n    <a id=\"emulate-a-class-feature\"></a><p><i>Emulate a Class Feature</i>: Sometimes you need to use a\nclass feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective\nlevel in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result\nminus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of\nanother class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class\nfeature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment\nrequirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an\nappropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see\nabove).</p>\n    <a id=\"emulate-a-race\"></a><p><i>Emulate a Race</i>: Some magic items work only for members\nof certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can\nuse such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate\nonly one race at a time.</p>\n    <a id=\"use-a-scroll\"></a><p><i>Use a Scroll</i>: If you are casting a spell from a scroll,\nyou have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll,\nyou must have the scroll&rsquo;s spell on your class spell list. Use\nMagic\nDevice allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on\nyour class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the\nspell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a\nspell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the\nappropriate ability. If you don&rsquo;t have a sufficient score in that\nability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic\nDevice check (see above).</p>\n    <p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion\nmagic items.</p>\n    <a id=\"use-a-wand\"></a><p><i>Use a Wand</i>: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the\nwand&rsquo;s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill\nallows you\nto use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell\nlist. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic\nitems, such as staffs.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: None. The Use Magic Device check is made as\npart of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while\nattempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can&rsquo;t try\nto\nactivate that item again for 24 hours.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>\n    <p>You can&rsquo;t aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only\nthe\nuser of the item may attempt such a check.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#magical-aptitude\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Magical Aptitude</a> feat, you get a\n+2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href=\"#spellcraft\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Spellcraft</a>,\nyou get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href=\"#decipher-script\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Decipher Script</a>, you get a +2\nbonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2\nbonus to Spellcraft checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"use-rope\">USE ROPE (DEX)</a></h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: Most tasks with a rope are\nrelatively simple.

Failure by\n4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing\nyou to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling\nhook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting\nweight.

You\ndon&rsquo;t even make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard\naction that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a\nspecial knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a\nfull-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two\nropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus\non Use Rope checks.
