In general, a deity only accepts\nminions who have accomplished some great deed in service to the deity.\nSuch minions usually have the same alignment as the deity. No\nminion&rsquo;s alignment is opposed to the patron deity&rsquo;s\nalignment on either the law-chaos axis or the good-evil axis. \n    <a id=\"proxies\"></a><h5>Proxies</h5>\nA divine proxy speaks and acts on behalf of the divine being.\nWhen the demand for a deity&rsquo;s presence is too high, the deity may\nuse proxies.\n    <p>Proxies are divine minions invested with a small portion of\nthe deity&rsquo;s power. A deity may invest 1 rank of its power\n(reducing its divine rank accordingly) in a single servant for as long\nas the deity chooses. The minion must be physically present for the\ndeity to perform the investiture. While so invested, the proxy gains\nany <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }} href=\"salientAbilities.html\">salient\ndivine abilities</a> held by the patron deity as well as the\npowers and abilities of a rank 1 demigod. Without the requisite ability\nscores or divine ranks, the proxy may not be able to use all those\npowers and abilities. A deity may have more than one proxy, but it must\nlose 1 divine rank for each proxy it invests. A deity can retrieve a\nsingle divine rank as a standard action, and doing so it does not\nrequire the physical presence of the proxy. </p>\n    <a id=\"petitioners\"></a><h5>Petitioners</h5>\nSome spirits demonstrate their devotion to their deity by\ntraveling to the deity&rsquo;s home plane. Those that survive the\njourney across the planes become servants of their deity. While a few\nmay remain disembodied spirits, most become petitioners through the\ndivine will of their patron deity.\n    <p>In general, petitioners appear in the form that they had when\nthey died, though they may be remade by deities to fit the nature of\ntheir particular afterlife. In general, petitioners who become divine\nservants are creatures that originally had at least 1 Intelligence and\n1 Wisdom.</p>\n    <p>The following creature types may become petitioners depending\non the deity: aberrations, animals, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids,\nmagical beasts, monstrous humanoids, and plants, oozes, and vermin with\nsufficient ability scores. Constructs and undead are not usually made\ninto petitioners, though the spirits of their original forms may be.\nElementals and outsiders tend to meld with their native planes, and as\nsuch do not become petitioners. Their spirits may still be called back\nfrom the dead, however.</p>\n    <p>The template presented below is for NPCs, not player\ncharacters. If dead characters who are petitioners are later restored\nto life (once again becoming player characters), they forget any of\ntheir experiences as petitioners.</p>\n    <a id=\"creating-a-petitioner\"></a><h6>Creating a Petitioner</h6>\n&ldquo;Petitioner&rdquo; is a template that may be added to\nany creature as determined by the nature of the campaign (referred to\nhereafter as the base creature).
