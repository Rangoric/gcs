In campaigns using these rules, characters gain a new\nattribute called Sanity. This statistic functions like an ability score in\nsome ways, but it has its own unique mechanics that represent the\ncharacter�s descent from a stable and healthy mental state into confusion,\ndementia, and mental instability. As a character encounters monsters,\nwitnesses horrible acts, masters forbidden knowledge, or casts spells, his\nSanity score, and his corresponding ability to function as a normal member\nof his race, deteriorates. This gradual descent is balanced in part by the\npowers that characters gain each time they overcome a horrific foe or grow\nin skill and expertise, but even as those characters grow in power, they\nknow or fear that an even greater peril lies ahead � the threat of becoming\npermanently insane.\n    <h5><a id=\"behind-the-curtain-sanity\"></a>\nBEHIND THE CURTAIN: SANITY\n    </h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>\nBecause it affects the way that characters interact with the creatures and\nobjects that they encounter on their adventures in many different and\nprofound ways, this variant, perhaps more than any other in Unearthed\nArcana, can alter the entire feel of a campaign. If you adopt this variant\nin your campaign, the largest change will most likely be one of tone (this\napplies to an even greater extent if you adopt the entire Cthulhu Mythos\nthat the variant is based on).\n      <p>\nAs in the Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, characters feel more\nvulnerable, for no matter how powerful they become, the dark gods are\nalways greater. Religion is not only a source of comfort or succor, but\nalso a dangerous enemy. (In those games that use the Cthulhu Mythos,\nreligion seldom provides any succor at all.) Characters are suspicious,\neven paranoid, for a seemingly innocent commoner could secretly serve a\ncult. And yet, with such dark challenges come the opportunities for\ngreater heroism.\n      </p></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"what-is-sanity\"></a>\nWHAT IS SANITY?\n    </h5>\nSanity is the natural mental state of ordinary life. Normal mental balance\nis endangered when characters confront horrors, entities, or activities\nthat are shocking, unnatural, and bewildering. Such encounters cause a\ncharacter to lose points from his Sanity score, which in turn risks\ntemporary, indefinite, or permanent insanity. Mental stability and lost\nSanity points can be restored, up to a point, but psychological scars may\nremain.\n    <p>\nInsanity occurs if too many Sanity points are lost in too short a time.\nInsanity does not necessarily occur if Sanity points are low, but a lower\nSanity score makes some forms of insanity more likely to occur after a\ncharacter experiences an emotional shock. The character�s Sanity may be\nregained after a few minutes, recovered after a few months, or lost\nforever.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA character may regain Sanity points, and even increase her Sanity point\nmaximum. However, increasing a character�s ranks in the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#knowledge-forbidden-lore\">Knowledge\n(forbidden lore)</a> skill always lowers her maximum Sanity by an equal\namount.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"forbidden-knowledge\"></a>\nFORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE\n    </h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>\nThe Sanity rules assume that some knowledge is so alien to human\nunderstanding that simply learning of its existence can shatter the\npsyche. While magic and nonhuman races form an everyday part of a d20\ncharacter�s life, even a seasoned adventurer cannot conquer or understand\nsome things. Knowledge of these secrets and creatures is represented by a\nnew skill that goes hand in hand with a character�s Sanity score:\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#knowledge-forbidden-lore\">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a>.\n      <p>\nThis type of knowledge permanently erodes a character�s ability to\nmaintain a stable and sane outlook, and a character�s current Sanity can\nnever be higher than 99 minus the modifier the character has in the\n        <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"#knowledge-forbidden-lore\">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> skill. This number (99 minus Knowledge\n[forbidden lore] ranks) is the character�s maximum Sanity.\n      </p>\n      <h6><a id=\"knowledge-forbidden-lore\"></a>\nKnowledge (Forbidden Lore) (None)\n      </h6>\nYou know That Which Should Not Be Known. You have had horrible\nsupernatural experiences and read forbidden tomes, learning truly dark\nsecrets that have challenged everything you thought you knew. Since these\nrevelations defy logic or commonly accepted fact, it does not matter how\nintelligent or wise you are when using this skill � only how much exposure\nto these dark secrets themselves you have experienced.\n      <p><b>Check:</b> Answering a question about the horrible deities and secrets that lurk at\nthe edges of reality has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for\nelementary questions), or 20 to 30 (for difficult or really tough\nquestions). Unlike in other fields of study, there are almost no really\neasy questions associated with this dark knowledge.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nYou can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or\nvulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the\nmonster�s HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful\ninformation about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check\nresult exceeds the DC, the GM can give another piece of useful\ninformation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nThe GM can decide which monsters are subject to the Knowledge (forbidden\nlore) skill and which monsters are subject to one of the standard\n        <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> skills. For example, the GM may rule that Knowledge (the planes)\nis still the relevant skill for learning or knowing about outsiders,\nrather than allowing them to be identified by Knowledge (forbidden lore).\nHowever, in most campaigns that use the Sanity variant, aberrations and\noozes should be able to be identified by Knowledge (forbidden lore) rather\nthan by Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (dungeoneering) respectively.\n      </p>\n      <p><b>Action:</b> Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn�t take an\naction�you simply know the answer or you don�t.\n      </p>\n      <p><b>Try Again:</b> No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a\nsecond time doesn�t let you know something that you never learned in the\nfirst place.\n      </p>\n      <p><b>Special:</b>You cannot gain ranks in this skill by spending skill points. You can only\ngain ranks by reading forbidden tomes or having experiences with horrible\ncreatures. Each rank you gain in this skill permanently reduces your\nmaximum Sanity by 1 point: The more you know about the horrible truths\nunderlying reality, the less capable you are of leading a normal life.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nA character�s first episode of insanity (that is, an occurrence of\ntemporary or indefinite insanity) bestows 2 ranks in the Knowledge\n(forbidden lore) skill, thereby lowering his maximum Sanity by 2 points.\nEach time a character fails a Sanity check and endures another episode of\ninsanity, he gains an additional rank in Knowledge (forbidden lore).\n      </p>\n      <p>\nFor example, Torin has 1 rank of Knowledge (forbidden lore) after\nreading a strange manuscript. She then steps outside, sees a chaos beast,\nand goes indefinitely insane, her raving mind failing to understand the\nstrange creature she has encountered. Since she has never gone insane\nbefore, her player adds 2 ranks of Knowledge (forbidden lore) to Torin�s\ncharacter sheet. Now Torin�s Maximum Sanity is 96 (99 minus 3 ranks of\nKnowledge [forbidden lore]).\n      </p>\n      <p>\nYou cannot take the Knowledge (forbidden lore) skill during character\ncreation. However, the skill has no maximum rank; your level does not\nlimit the number of ranks in Knowledge (forbidden lore) that you can\nacquire.\n      </p></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"sanity-points\"></a>\nSANITY POINTS\n    </h5>\nSanity points measure the stability of a character�s mind. This attribute\nprovides a way to define the sanity inherent in a character, the most\nstability a character can ever have, and the current level of sane\nrationality that a character preserves, even after numerous shocks and\nhorrid revelations.\n    <p>\nSanity is measured in three ways: starting Sanity, current Sanity, and\nmaximum Sanity. Starting and current Sanity cannot exceed maximum Sanity.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"starting-sanity\"></a>\nStarting Sanity\n    </h6>\nA character�s starting Sanity equals his Wisdom score multiplied by 5.\nThis score represents a starting character�s current Sanity, as well as\nthe upper limit of Sanity that can be restored by the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#heal\">Heal</a> skill (see <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#the-heal-skill-and-mental-treatment\">The\nHeal Skill and Mental Treatment</a>, later in this section). After creation, a\ncharacter�s current Sanity often fluctuates considerably and might never\nagain match starting Sanity. A change in a character�s Wisdom score\nchanges his starting Sanity in terms of what treatment with the Heal skill\ncan restore. Current Sanity, however, does not change if Wisdom rises or\nfalls.\n    <h6><a id=\"current-sanity\"></a>\nCurrent Sanity\n    </h6>\nA character�s current Sanity score fluctuates almost as often as (and\nsometimes much more often than) his hit points.\n    <p><b><a id=\"making-a-sanity-check\"></a>Making a Sanity Check:</b>\nWhen a character encounters a gruesome, unnatural, or supernatural\nsituation, the GM may require the player to make a Sanity check using\npercentile dice (d%). The check succeeds if the result is equal to or less\nthan the character�s current Sanity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nOn a successful check, the character either loses no Sanity points or\nloses only a minimal amount. Potential Sanity loss is usually shown as two\nnumbers or die rolls separated by a slash, such as 0/1d4. The number\nbefore the slash indicates the number of Sanity points lost if the Sanity\ncheck succeeds (in this case, none); the number after the slash indicates\nthe number of Sanity points lost if the Sanity check fails (in this case,\nbetween 1 and 4 points).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA character�s current Sanity is also at risk when the character reads\ncertain books, learns certain types of spells, and attempts to cast them.\nThese Sanity losses are usually automatic (no Sanity check is allowed);\nthe character who chooses to undertake the activity forfeits the indicated\nnumber of Sanity points.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIn most cases, a new Sanity-shaking confrontation requires a new Sanity\ncheck. However, the GM always gets to decide when characters make Sanity\nchecks. Confronting several horribly mangled corpses at one time or in\nrapid succession may call for just one Sanity check, while the same\ncorpses encountered singly over the course of several game hours may\nrequire separate checks.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"going-insane\"></a>Going Insane:</b>\nLosing more than a few Sanity points may cause a character to go insane,\nas described below. If a character�s Sanity score drops to 0 or lower, she\nbegins the quick slide into permanent insanity. Each round, the character\nloses another point of Sanity. Once a character�s Sanity score reaches\n-10, she is hopelessly, incurably insane. The <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#heal\">Heal</a> skill can be used to\nstabilize a character on the threshold of permanent insanity; see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#the-heal-skill-and-mental-treatment\">The Heal\nSkill and Mental Treatment</a>, below, for details.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA GM�s description of a Sanity-shaking situation should always justify the\nthreat to a character�s well-being. Thus, a horde of frothing rats is\nhorrifying, while a single ordinary rat usually is not (unless the\ncharacter has an appropriate phobia, of course).\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"maximum-sanity\"></a>\nMaximum Sanity\n    </h6>\nRanks in the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#knowledge-forbidden-lore\">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> skill simulate a character�s\ncomprehension of aspects of the dark creatures at the edges of reality.\nOnce gained, this horrible knowledge is never forgotten, and the character\nconsequently surrenders mental equilibrium. A character�s Sanity weakens\nas his comprehension of these hidden truths increases. Such is the way of\nthe universe.\n    <p>\nA character�s current Sanity can never be higher than 99 minus the\ncharacter�s ranks in the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#knowledge-forbidden-lore\">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> skill. This number (99\nminus Knowledge [forbidden lore] ranks) is the character�s maximum Sanity.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"loss-of-sanity\"></a>\nLOSS OF SANITY\n    </h5>\nCharacters ordinarily lose Sanity in a few types of circumstances: when\nencountering something unimaginable, when suffering a severe shock, after\ncasting a spell or when learning a new spell, when being affected by a\ncertain type of magic or a particular spell, or when reading a forbidden\ntome.\n    <h6><a id=\"encountering-the-unimaginable\"></a>\nEncountering the Unimaginable\n    </h6>\nWhen people perceive creatures and entities of unspeakable horror, this\nexperience costs them some portion of their minds, since such creatures\nare intrinsically discomforting and repellent. We never lose awareness of\ntheir slimy, fetid, alien nature. This instinctive reaction is part and\nparcel of humans, elves, dwarves, and other humanoid races. In this\ncategory, we can include supernatural events or agents not always\nrecognized as specifically devoted to these dark gods, such as hauntings,\nzombies, vampires, curses, and so on.\n    <p>\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-sanity-loss-from-creatures\">Table: Sanity Loss from Creatures</a> provides some default Sanity loss values\nfor encountering creatures, based on their type and size. These are only\ndefault values � the GM can and should adjust individual monsters he deems\nmore or less horrible than others of their size. An <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersOtoR.html#planetouched\">aasimar</a>, for instance,\nhardly presents a Sanity-shaking sight, and should probably be treated as\na humanoid rather than an outsider.

For\ninstance, an <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersA.html#aboleth\">aboleth</a> is an\nunnerving sight, but watching one transform your best friend with it's\nslime should certainly force another check, with losses appropriate to the\nsituation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIn most d20 games, no character should need to make a Sanity check when\nencountering an elf, dwarf, or other standard humanoid race, or for\nencountering domesticated or otherwise commonplace animals. In some cases,\neven humanoid races such as orcs and goblins might be so common as to not\ncause Sanity loss either.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"specific-monsters-and-sanity\"></a>Specific Monsters and Sanity:</b>\nSome monsters have additional or variant special abilities when using the\nSanity variant.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"monstersA.html#allip\">Allip</a>:</i>\nThe allip�s madness ability causes the loss of 2d6 Sanity points rather\nthan the normal effect.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"monstersDtoDe.html#derro\">Derro</a>:</i>\nThe derro�s madness ability protects these creatures from any further\nSanity loss.

By casting spells,\ncharacters visualize the unimaginable, warping their minds to follow alien\nways of thought. These visualizations wound the mind. Although\nspellcasters expose themselves to such traumas voluntarily, they are\nshocks all the same.\n    <p>\nIn this variant, casting a spell drains a certain amount of Sanity. This\nrule represents the fact that spellcasting forces the mind into strange\npatterns and thought processes with which it is poorly equipped to deal.\nThe GM can choose from the three options presented in the table below,\ndeducting a low, moderate, or extreme number of Sanity points from a\ncharacter who casts a spell. In a campaign featuring low Sanity loss, a\nspellcaster is rarely penalized for casting a spell, especially if the GM\nalso chooses to give characters <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#sanity-resistance\">Sanity resistance</a> in\nsuch cases. In a campaign featuring moderate Sanity loss, spellcasters\nface a slightly higher risk of insanity than members of other classes,\neven if they have Sanity resistance. When using this option, players\nshould, for the most part, choose spellcasting levels only as multiclass\noptions. In a campaign featuring extreme Sanity loss, spellcasters have a\ndifficult time participating in adventures regularly because they find it\nhard to use their classes� primary abilities without soon going insane.\n    </p>\n    <a id=\"table-sanity-loss-from-spellcasting\"></a>\n    <table cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"40%\"\n    }}>\n      <tr>\n        <th>\nSpell\n          <p>{`Level`}</p>\n        </th>\n        <th>\nLow\n          <p>{`Sanity Loss`}</p>\n        </th>\n        <th>\nModerate\n          <p>{`Sanity Loss`}</p>\n        </th>\n        <th>\nExtreme\n          <p>{`Sanity Loss`}</p>\n        </th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td align=\"center\">\n1st\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n1\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n2\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n1d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n2nd\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n2\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n4\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n2d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td align=\"center\">\n3rd\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n3\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n6\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n3d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n4th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n4\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n8\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n4d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td align=\"center\">\n5th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n5\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n10\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n5d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n6th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n6\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n12\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n6d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td align=\"center\">\n7th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n7\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n14\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n7d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n8th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n8\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n16\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n8d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td align=\"center\">\n9th\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n9\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n18\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n9d6\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\nIn addition to the guidelines presented for each campaign option above,\nthe GM is free to impose additional modifiers on the Sanity loss caused by\nspells of a certain type, a certain school, or even individual spells.\nHere are some example conditions that a GM could choose to incorporate\ninto a game.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Abjurations cost 1 less Sanity point to cast.\n      </li>\n      <li>Divine spells cost 5 additional Sanity points to cast.\n      </li>\n      <li>Druids suffer only half the Sanity loss from spellcasting (round\nfractions up).\n      </li>\n      <li>Healing spells drain no Sanity when cast.\n      </li>\n      <li>The invisibility spell, and any variation thereof, costs 1 additional\nSanity Point to cast.\n      </li>\n      <li>Necromancy spells cost 2 additional Sanity points to cast.\n      </li>\n      <li>Spellcasters of some classes follow the guidelines of one campaign\noption, while spellcasters of other classes follow the guidelines of\nanother campaign option.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h6><a id=\"learning-spells\"></a>\nLearning Spells\n    </h6>\nLearning spells, like casting them, exposes a character to unknowable\nsecrets and can damage and warp the mind. In this variant, whenever a\nspellcaster learns a new spell, he loses Sanity points. In most cases, the\nSanity loss is equal to the spell�s level, but if the spell is included in\na tome of forbidden knowledge (see below), the loss can be greater.\n    <p>\nThe rules for Sanity loss for learning spells work fine for wizards,\nsorcerers, and other arcane spellcasting classes that learn spells one at\na time or in small groups, but this loss can easily overwhelm a cleric,\ndruid, or other divine spellcaster who gains a new spellcasting level\n(thereby �learning� an entire level�s worth of new spells all at once). In\nsuch a case, the player and the GM should work together to determine a\nspecific number of spells learned once access to a new spellcasting level\nis gained. When in doubt about how many spells to allow a spellcaster to\nlearn at any given level, the spell acquisition rate of the wizard class\nserves as a good baseline.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nGMs wanting to add Sanity rules to a magic-rich campaign, or those wishing\nto preserve more of the flavor of a normal d20 game, can allow any\nspellcaster to learn a small number of spells at each level without losing\nany Sanity.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"sanity-affecting-magic\"></a>\nSanity-Affecting Magic\n    </h6>\nThe following types of magic and specific spells have different or\nadditional effects when the Sanity variant is in use.

Since d20 characters live in a world of magic and\nmonsters, however, the GM might want to make them less susceptible to\nSanity loss caused by encountering strange creatures (see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-sanity-loss-from-creatures\">Table: Sanity\nLoss from Creatures</a>) by allowing them to have a measure of Sanity\nresistance, which is tied to one of two attributes.\n      <p>\nEach character can be allowed to have Sanity resistance equal to his\ncharacter level. Alternatively, each character can be allowed to have\nSanity resistance equal to his Wisdom modifier. (Obviously, the second\nalternative will produce lower Sanity resistance figures in most cases.)\nThis number is the amount of Sanity loss a character can ignore when he\nencounters a creature that requires a Sanity check.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nThe GM may decide that Sanity resistance also applies to certain kinds of\nsevere shocks (although it might not apply to personally horrific\nexperiences, such as seeing a close friend die) and to the casting or\nlearning of spells.\n      </p></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"getting-used-to-awfulness\"></a>\nGETTING USED TO AWFULNESS\n    </h5>\nNever underestimate the ability of the sentient mind to adapt, even to the\nmost horrific experiences. Reading and rereading the same bit of\ndisturbing text or seeing the same horrible image over and over eventually\nprovokes no further loss of Sanity. Within a reasonable interval of play,\nusually a single session of the game, characters should not lose more\nSanity points for seeing monsters of a particular sort than the maximum\npossible points a character could lose from seeing one such monster. For\ninstance, the Sanity loss for seeing a single human <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"monstersTtoZ.html#zombie\">zombie</a> is 1/1d6. Thus,\nin the same game day or in the same play session, no character should lose\nmore than 6 Sanity points for seeing any number of zombies. Keep in mind\nthat the interpretation of �reasonable interval� must vary by GM and\nsituation. When it feels right, the GM should rule that the horror is\nrenewed and points must be lost again.\n    <p>\nLearning or casting spells never becomes a normal occurrence. No matter\nhow many times a character casts a spell, no matter what the time interval\nbetween castings may be, the Sanity loss is always the same. This point is\nalso true for anything that a character does willingly. For example, if\nbrutally murdering a friend costs 2/1d10 Sanity, this loss is incurred\neach time, even if the character loses the maximum possible points (10)\nafter the first such murder he commits.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"types-of-insanity\"></a>\nTYPES OF INSANITY\n    </h5>\nCharacter insanity is induced by a swift succession of shocking\nexperiences or ghastly revelations, events usually connected with dark\ngods, creatures from the Outer Planes, or powerful spellcasting.\n    <p>\nHorrifying encounters can result in one of three states of mental\nunbalance: temporary, indefinite, and permanent insanity. The first two,\ntemporary insanity and indefinite insanity, can be cured. The third,\npermanent insanity, results when a character�s Sanity points are reduced\nto -10 or lower. This condition cannot be cured.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"temporary-insanity\"></a>\nTemporary Insanity\n    </h6>\nWhenever a character loses Sanity points equal to one-half her Wisdom\nscore from a single episode of Sanity loss, she has experienced enough of\na shock that the GM must ask for a Sanity check. If the check fails, the\ncharacter realizes the full significance of what she saw or experienced\nand goes temporarily insane. If the check succeeds, the character does not\ngo insane, but she may not clearly remember what she experienced (a trick\nthe mind plays to protect itself).\n    <p>\nTemporary insanity might last for a few minutes or a few days. Perhaps the\ncharacter acquires a phobia or fetish befitting the situation, faints,\nbecomes hysterical, or suffers nervous twitches, but she can still respond\nrationally enough to run away or hide from a threat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA character suffering from temporary insanity remains in this state for\neither a number of rounds or a number of hours; roll d% and consult <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-duration-of-temporary-insanity\">Table:\nDuration of Temporary Insanity</a> to see whether the insanity is\nshort-term or long-term. After determining the duration of the insanity,\nroll d% and consult either <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-short-term-temporary-insanity-effects\">Table: Short-Term Temporary Insanity Effects</a>\nor <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-long-term-temporary-insanity-effects\">Table: Long-Term Temporary Insanity Effects</a> to identify the specific\neffect of the insanity. The GM must describe the effect so that the player\ncan roleplay it accordingly. Ideas for phobias and episodes of insanity\nare described later in this chapter.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSuccessful application of the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#heal\">Heal</a> skill (see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#the-heal-skill-and-mental-treatment\">The Heal Skill and Mental\nTreatment</a>, below) may alleviate or erase temporary insanity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTemporary insanity ends either when the duration rolled on <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-duration-of-temporary-insanity\">Table: Duration of Temporary Insanity</a> has\nelapsed, or earlier if the GM considers it appropriate to do so.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAfter an episode of temporary insanity ends, traces or even profound\nevidence of the experience should remain. No reason exists why, for\ninstance, a phobia should depart from someone�s mind as quickly as a\nwarrior draws his sword. What remains behind after a brief episode of\ntemporary insanity should exert a pervasive influence on the character.\nThe character may still be a bit batty, but her conscious mind once again\nruns the show.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAs a variant rule, if the amount of Sanity lost exceeds the character�s\ncurrent Wisdom score, consider the temporary insanity to always be of the\nlong-term variety.\n

more of her current Sanity points\nin the space of 1 hour, she goes indefinitely insane. The GM judges when\nthe impact of events calls for such a measure. Some GMs never apply the\nconcept to more than the result of a single roll, since this state can\nremove characters from play for extended periods. An episode of indefinite\ninsanity lasts for 1d6 game months (or as the GM dictates). Symptoms of\nindefinite insanity may not be immediately apparent (which may give the GM\nadditional time to decide what the effects of such a bout of insanity\nmight be).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#table-random-indefinite-insanity\">Table: Random Indefinite Insanity</a> is provided as an aid to selecting\nwhat form a character�s indefinite insanity takes. (The mental disorders\nmentioned on this table are explained later in this section.) Many GMs\nprefer to choose an appropriate way for the insanity to manifest, based on\nthe circumstances that provoked it. It�s also a good idea to consult with\nthe player of the afflicted character to see what sort of mental malady\nthe player wishes to roleplay.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThe state of indefinite insanity is encompassing and incapacitating. For\ninstance, a schizophrenic may be able to walk the streets while babbling\nand gesticulating, find rudimentary shelter, and beg for enough food to\nsurvive, but most of the business of the mind has departed into itself:\nShe cannot fully interact with friends, family, and acquaintances.\nConversation, cooperation, and all sense of personal regard have vanished\nfrom her psyche.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIt is possible for characters with indefinite insanity to continue to be\nplayed as active characters, depending on the form their madness takes.\nThe character may still attempt to stumble madly through the rest of an\nadventure. However, with her weakened grasp on reality, she is most likely\na danger to herself and others.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAs a general rule, a character suffering from indefinite insanity should\nbe removed from active play until she recovers. At the GM�s discretion,\nthe player of the character might be allowed to use a temporary character\nuntil the end of the story. Whether this �stand-in� character is an\nincidental NPC in the adventure, a character of the same level as the rest\nof the group, one or two levels below the rest of the characters, or even\na 1st-level character, is up to the GM. Different GMs have different ways\nof handling this transition.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf a character goes indefinitely insane near the end of an adventure, the\nGM may decide to set the next adventure to begin after the insane\ncharacter has recovered.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nCharacters suffering from indefinite insanity are in limbo, unable to help\nthemselves or others. The <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#heal\">Heal</a> skill can be used to restore Sanity points\nduring this period, but the underlying insanity remains.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAfter recovery, a victim retains definite traces of madness. For example,\neven though a character knows he is no longer insane, she might be deathly\nafraid of going to sleep if her insanity manifested itself in the form of\nterrifying nightmares. The character is in control of her actions, but the\nexperience of insanity has changed her, perhaps forever.\n    </p>\n    <b><a id=\"table-random-indefinite-insanity\"></a>Table: Random Indefinite Insanity</b>\n    <table cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"40%\"\n    }}>\n      <tr>\n        <th>\nd%\n        </th>\n        <th align=\"left\">\nMental Disorder Type\n        </th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td>\n01�15\n        </td>\n        <td>\nAnxiety (includes severe phobias)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n16�20\n        </td>\n        <td>\nDissociative (amnesia, multiple personalities)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td>\n21�25\n        </td>\n        <td>\nEating (anorexia, bulimia)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n26�30\n        </td>\n        <td>\nImpulse control (compulsions)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td>\n31�35\n        </td>\n        <td>\nMood (manic/depressive)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n36�45\n        </td>\n        <td>\nPersonality (various neuroses)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td>\n46�50\n        </td>\n        <td>\nPsychosexual (sadism, nymphomania)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n51�55\n        </td>\n        <td>\nPsychospecies\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td>\n56�70\n        </td>\n        <td>\nSchizophrenia/psychotic (delusions,\nhallucinations, paranoia, catatonia)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n71�80\n        </td>\n        <td>\nSleep (night terrors, sleepwalking)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td>\n81�85\n        </td>\n        <td>\nSomatoform (psychosomatic conditions)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n86�95\n        </td>\n        <td>\nSubstance abuse (alcoholic, drug addict)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n        <td>\n96�100\n        </td>\n        <td>\nOther (megalomania, quixotism, panzaism)\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <h6><a id=\"permanent-insanity\"></a>\nPermanent Insanity\n    </h6>\nA character whose Sanity score falls to -10 goes permanently insane.

It is quite believable, for example, that a group of wizards discovered alchemical means of\nisolating substances that affect the mind in profound ways, offering many\nof the same benefits of modern medicine. Therefore, the GM need only\ndecide how easily he wants characters to overcome Sanity loss and insanity\neffects. Once the desired tone of the campaign is known, the GM can\ndetermine whether alchemical treatment is available.

Sometimes, an individual�s long-term\naddiction raises a drug�s addiction rating for that individual. Drugs with\na negligible rating are not subject to this change. Stronger drugs\nincrease their addiction rating by one step for every two full months a\ncharacter remains addicted to the drug. A character who recovers from an\naddiction and later becomes addicted again to the same drug does so at the\naddiction rating the drug had just prior to his earlier recovery.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"satiation\"></a>Satiation:</b>\nEach time a user takes a drug to which he is addicted, he is satiated and\nstaves off withdrawal symptoms for the period of time indicated on the\ntable.

Thus, <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#indefinite-insanity\">indefinite insanity</a> is the only form of\nmental illness that might be addressed by intervention and treatment.\n    <p>\nAfter 1d6 months, if undisturbed by further trauma and with the agreement\nof the Game Master, an indefinitely insane character finds enough mental\nbalance to reenter the world. Three kinds of nonmagical care may help the\ncharacter regain Sanity points during this recovery period. When choosing\namong them, the GM and player should consider the character�s resources,\nher friends and relatives, and how wisely she has behaved in the past. In\nmost campaigns, the magical treatments described above (see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#restoring-sanity-with-magic\">Restoring\nSanity with Magic</a>) allow the character to reenter play after a shorter\ntime or with less expense.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"private-care\"></a>\nPrivate Care\n    </h6>\nThe best care available is at home or in some friendly place (perhaps a\nsmall church or the home of a wealthy friend) where nursing can be tender,\nconsiderate, and undistracted by the needs of competing patients.\n    <p>\nIf mental healing or alchemical medications are available, roll d% for\neach game month that one or the other is used. A result of 01-95 is a\nsuccess: Add 1d3 Sanity points for either mental therapy or alchemical\nmedications, whichever is used (a character cannot benefit from both in\nthe same month). On a result of 96-100, the healer fumbles the diagnosis\nor the character rejects the alchemical treatments. She loses 1d6 Sanity\npoints, and no progress is made that month.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"institutionalization\"></a>\nInstitutionalization\n    </h6>\nThe next best alternative to private care is commitment to a good insane\nasylum, but these are extremely rare in most d20 campaigns, if they are\npresent at all. GMs are free to rule that institutionalization is simply\nnot available.\n    <p>\nIn those campaigns that include such institutions (usually located within\nthe bounds of a temple devoted to a deity of healing), asylums may be said\nto have an advantage over home care in that they are relatively cheap or\neven a free service provided by a government or a powerful church. These\ninstitutions are of uneven quality, however, and some may be potentially\nharmful. Some are creative places of experiment and magic-assisted\ntherapy, while others offer mere confinement. In any setting, concentrated\nand nourishing treatment by strangers is rare.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTherapy using the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#heal\">Heal</a> skill is usually the only treatment available, but\nin most cases, primitive institutions offer no treatment at all. Sometimes\nan institution can convey an uncaring sense that undermines the useful\neffects of alchemical medications, leaving the character with a sense of\nanger and loss. He is likely to be distrustful of the organization and its\nmotives. Escape attempts are common by inmates, even in the most\nenlightened fantasy settings.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nRoll d% for each game month a character is in the care of an institution.\nA result of 01-95 is a success; add 1d3 Sanity points if therapy with the\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#heal\">Heal</a> skill was available, or 1 Sanity point if no treatment was present.\nOn a result of 96-100, the character rebels against the environment. He\nloses 1d6 Sanity points, and no progress can be made that month.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"wandering-and-homeless\"></a>\nWandering and Homeless\n    </h6>\nIf no care is available, an insane character may become a wandering\nderelict struggling for survival. Such a wanderer gains no Sanity points\nunless he is able to join a group of the homeless and find at least one\nfriend among them. To find a friend after joining such a group, the\ncharacter can make a DC 15 Charisma check once per month. If a friend\nappears, the character recovers 1 Sanity point per game month thereafter.\n    <p>\nFor each game month during which an insane character lives as a derelict,\nroll d%. On a result of 01-95, the character survives. On a result of\n96-100, the character dies as the result of disease, exposure, or\nviolence.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"mental-disorders\"></a>\nMENTAL DISORDERS\n    </h5>\nThe GM should choose how characters in the campaign world think and\ntherefore talk about insanity before play begins. In many fantasy games,\nthe term �insane� serves as an all-encompassing term that represents\neverything an inhabitant knows or understands about the full spectrum of\nmental disorders. In others, different forms of insanity may be identified\nfor what they are.\n    <p>\nThis section offers descriptions of many specific mental disorders. Where\nappropriate, suggested modifiers to characters� attack rolls, saves, and\nchecks are also given.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"anxiety-disorders\"></a>\nAnxiety Disorders\n    </h6>\nEven a seasoned adventurer feels anxious before braving a dragon�s cave,\nand the farmers in the village might worry that their crops will not\nsurvive until harvest. These fears are a normal, natural part of living in\na danger-filled environment such as a d20 campaign setting, but in some\ncases these anxieties overwhelm an individual, causing inactivity,\ndistress, and even severe behavioral problems. When fear and anxiety\noverwhelm a character for a prolonged period of time, the character\nsuffers from an anxiety disorder. The most common forms of anxiety\ndisorders are described below.\n    <p><b><a id=\"generalized-anxiety-disorder\"></a>Generalized Anxiety Disorder:</b>\nThe character suffers from a variety of physical and emotional symptoms\nthat can be grouped into certain categories.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"motor-tension\"></a>Motor Tension:</i>\nJitteriness, aches, twitches, restlessness, easily startled, easily\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued\">fatigued</a>, and so on.

These ideas are\nfrequently repugnant to the character, but they are so strong that during\ntimes of stress she may be unable to concentrate on anything else, even if\ndoing so is necessary for her survival. Obsessive impulses can be very\ndangerous when combined with auditory hallucinations, since the �voices�\nmay urge the character to take some dangerous or hostile course of action.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"compulsions\"></a>Compulsions:</i>\nThe character insists on performing ritual actions, such as touching a\ndoorway at left, right, and top before passing through it. Though she may\nagree that the actions are senseless, the need to perform them is\noverpowering and may last for 1d10 rounds. Even in times of great stress,\nthe character may ignore her survival in order to perform the actions.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"post-traumatic-stress-disorder\"></a>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:</b>\nAfter a traumatic event, perhaps even years later, the character begins to\nrelive the trauma through persistent thoughts, dreams, and flashbacks.\nCorrespondingly, the character loses interest in daily activities. She may\nreturn to normal once the memories have been thoroughly explored and\nunderstood, but that process may take years.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"phobia-or-mania\"></a>Phobia or Mania:</b>\nA character afflicted by a phobia or a mania persistently fears a\nparticular object or situation. She realizes that the fear is excessive\nand irrational, but the fear is disturbing enough that she avoids the\nstimulus.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"phobia\"></a>Phobia:</i>\n      <a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/UnA_Gallery/79181.jpg\"><img className=\"art-wide\" src=\"pict.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"pict\" style={{\n          \"border\": \"0px solid\",\n          \"width\": \"73px\",\n          \"height\": \"75px\"\n        }} /></a>A DC 15 Will check is required for a character to be able to force herself\ninto (or remain within) the presence of the object of her phobia, and even\nthen the character takes a -2 morale penalty as long as the object of fear\nremains. In severe cases, the object of the phobia is imagined to be\nomnipresent, perhaps hidden � thus, someone with severe acrophobia (fear of\nheights) might be frightened when in an enclosed room on the upper story\nof a building, even if there were no window or other way to see how high\nup the room was. As many phobias exist as one cares to notice or name � the\nlists provided below cover merely some of the more common phobias that\nmight affect d20 characters.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"mania\"></a>Mania:</i>\nManias are rarer than phobias. A character affected by a mania is\ninordinately fond of a particular stimulus and takes great pains to be\nwith it or near it. When the character�s sexuality is involved, the mania\nmay be termed a fetish. Thus, teratophobia would be an inordinate fear of\nmonsters, while teratophilia would be an unhealthy (possibly sexual)\nattraction to them. See the following lists of phobias for ideas on what\nsorts of disorders could manifest as manias.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"real-world-phobias\"></a>Real-World Phobias:</b>\nThe following list provides examples of phobias from the real world that\nlend themselves to inclusion in a d20 campaign.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nCertain real-world phobias can easily be broadened to include monstrous\ncreatures and specific magic effects in a fantasy environment. For\nexample, ophidiophobia (fear of snakes) could be extended to include\nmedusae and other snakelike creatures, or ichthyophobia (fear of fish)\ncould be extended to include aquatic creatures with fishlike qualities,\nsuch as the locathah and the sahuagin.\n    </p>\n    <table cellSpacing=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tr>\n        <td

The\ndisorder often involves some great previous trauma that is too terrible to\nremember. Characters who have gone insane from an encounter with powerful\nmonsters often suffer from some form of dissociative disorder.\n    <p><b><a id=\"dissociative-amnesia-psychogenic-amnesia\"></a>Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Amnesia):</b>\nThis is the inability to recall important personal information, brought on\nby a desire to avoid unpleasant memories. The character must make a DC 20\nWill save to recall such details or the cause of the amnesia. Since the\nhorror of evil creatures and disturbing truths is the probable cause of\nthis amnesia, as an optional rule the GM may choose to reset the\ncharacter�s <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#knowledge-forbidden-lore\">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> modifier to +0 and her maximum\nSanity to 99 while this disorder holds sway: The horror returns only when\nthe character�s memories do.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"dissociative-fuge\"></a>Dissociative Fugue:</b>\nThe character flees from home or work and cannot recall her past.

The player needs to keep track of the character�s different\npersonalities. (Each one has the same ability scores and game statistics,\nbut different goals, outlooks, and attitudes.)\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"eating-disorders\"></a>\nEating Disorders\n    </h6>\nThese disorders can be incredibly debilitating and even lead to\nstarvation. They are conditions that may continue for many years,\nsometimes continually endangering the patient.\n    <p><b><a id=\"anorexia-nervosa\"></a>Anorexia Nervosa:</b>\nThe character has an overpowering fear of becoming fat and consequently\nloses weight, as well as taking <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#ability-damaged\">Constitution damage</a> (at a rate of 1d8\npoints per week).

Feelings of depression and guilt frequently follow such\nepisodes.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"impulse-control-disorders\"></a>\nImpulse Control Disorders\n    </h6>\nThese disorders include compulsive gambling, pathological lying,\nkleptomania (compulsive stealing), and pyromania (the compulsion to set\nfires).\n    <p><b><a id=\"intermittent-explosive-disorder\"></a>Intermittent Explosive Disorder:</b>\nThe character is recognizably impulsive and aggressive, and at times gives\nway to uncontrollable rages that result in assault or destruction of\nproperty.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"mood-disorders\"></a>\nMood Disorders\n    </h6>\nThese disorders affect the victim�s attitude and outlook. Mild mood\ndisorders can be almost impossible to detect without prolonged contact\nwith an individual, but severe disorders usually have noticeable symptoms.\n    <p><b><a id=\"depression\"></a>Depression:</b>\nSymptoms of this illness include changes in appetite, weight gain or loss,\ntoo much or too little sleep, persistent feeling of tiredness or\nsluggishness, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt, leading in severe\ncases to hallucinations, delusions, stupor, or thoughts of suicide. All\nattack rolls, saves, and checks take a -4 morale penalty. A predisposition\nto use alcohol or other mood-altering substances in an attempt at\nself-medication exists. A character suffering from severe chronic\ndepression may give up virtually all effort from feelings of\nhopelessness � for example, deciding not to get out of bed for two years.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"mood-disorder-mania\"></a>Mania:</b>\nThe character has a fairly constant euphoric or possibly irritable mood.\nSymptoms include a general increase in activity, talkativeness, increased\nself-esteem to the point of delusion, decreased need for sleep, being\neasily distracted, willingness for dangerous or imprudent activities such\nas reckless driving, delusions, hallucinations, and bizarre behavior.

This is an important point to\nkeep in mind when roleplaying � few players want to spend time with another\nplayer character suffering from a personality disorder.\n    <p>\nIn game terms, the character takes a -4 penalty on all Charisma-based\nchecks. In addition, the attitudes of NPCs the character encounters are\nshifted in a negative direction. When determining NPC atitudes, the\nplayer must make a Charisma check for the character. On a successful\ncheck, the attitude of the NPC in question shifts one step toward hostile;\non a failed check, the attitude of the NPC in question shifts two steps\ntoward hostile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nPersonality disorders are classified in the following categories.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"antisocial\"></a>Antisocial:</b>\nShort-sighted and reckless behavior, habitual liar, confrontational, fails\nto meet obligations (job, bills, relationships), disregards rights and\nfeelings of others.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"avoidant\"></a>Avoidant:</b>\nOversensitive to rejection, low self-esteem, socially withdrawn.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"borderline\"></a>Borderline:</b>\nRapid mood shifts, impulsive, unable to control temper, chronic boredom.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"compulsive\"></a>Compulsive:</b>\nPerfectionist, authoritarian, indecisive from fear of making mistakes,\ndifficulty expressing emotions.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"dependent\"></a>Dependent:</b>\nLacks self-confidence; seeks another to look up to, follow, and\nsubordinate herself to (�codependent�).\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"histrionic\"></a>Histrionic:</b>\nOverly dramatic, craves attention and excitement, overreacts, displays\ntemper tantrums, may threaten suicide if thwarted.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"narcissistic\"></a>Narcissistic:</b>\nExaggerated sense of self-importance, craves attention and admiration,\nconsiders others� rights and feelings as of lesser importance.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"passive-aggressive\"></a>Passive-Aggressive:</b>\nProcrastinator, stubborn, intentionally forgetful, deliberately\ninefficient.

A victim\nmight believe that she is a construct (and therefore immune to critical\nhits) or any other creature type that she has encountered. When a victim\nhas a psychospecies disorder associated with a creature that has specific\nweaknesses (for example, a human thinking he�s a <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"monstersTtoZ.html#vampire\">vampire</a>), then the\nvictim�s behavior changes become more noticeable (such as a fear of holy\nsymbols and sunlight).\n    <h6><a id=\"schizophrenia-and-other-psychotic-disorders\"></a>\nSchizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders\n    </h6>\nA psychotic character experiences a break with reality. Symptoms can\ninclude delusions, hallucinations, and cognitive impairment. In general,\nonly alchemical substances or magic can treat these kinds of disorders.\nNote, however, that many psychotic characters suffer from the delusion\nthat nothing is wrong with them, and hence they feel no need to take their\nmedication.\n    <p><b><a id=\"schizophrenia-schizophreniform-disorder-dementia-praecox\"></a>Schizophrenia (Schizophreniform Disorder, Dementia Praecox):</b>\nA schizophrenic character�s attention span and ability to concentration\nare greatly diminished; to reflect this, use only one-half of the\ncharacter�s normal skill modifier on any skill check requiring\nattentiveness (such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#disable-device\">Disable Device</a>, <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#spot\">Spot</a>, <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#search\">Search</a>, <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#open-lock\">Open Lock</a>, and of\ncourse <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#concentration\">Concentration</a>). Symptoms include bizarre delusions, paranoia,\nauditory hallucinations (�hearing voices�), incoherent speech, emotional\ndetachment, social withdrawal, bizarre behavior, and a lack of the sense\nof self.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA schizophrenic character may fit into one of the following categories.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"undifferentiated-schizophrenia\"></a>Undifferentiated:</i>\nImpaired cognitive function, emotional detachment.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"disorganized-schizophrenia\"></a>Disorganized:</i>\nInappropriate behavior, shallow emotional responses, delusions,\nhallucinations.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"catatonic-schizophrenia\"></a>Catatonic:</i>\nMutism (loss of ability to talk), extreme compliance, absence of all\nvoluntary movements, complete immobility (�statuism�).\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"paranoid-schizophrenia\"></a>Paranoid:</i>\nDelusions of persecution, illogical thinking, hallucinations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSymptoms from more than one type can occur in the same individual, along\nwith mood disorders (see above). For example, catatonic schizophrenics\nsometimes have manic episodes of extreme activity alternating with periods\nof complete withdrawal. Schizophrenia brought on by sudden stress is\ncalled acute schizophrenia; characters who go insane and babble of vast\nglobal conspiracies usually are diagnosed as suffering from �acute\nparanoid schizophrenia.�\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"other-psychotic-disorders\"></a>Other Psychotic Disorders:</b>\nBy some definitions, all severe mental illnesses are classified as\npsychoses, including mood disorders, dementia, and anxiety disorders. This\nsection deals with some of the interesting behavioral syndromes that may\nturn up in your game.\n    </p>\n    <p><i><a id=\"amok\"></a>Amok:</i>\n�Running amok,� an outburst of violence and aggressive or homicidal\nbehavior directed at people and property.

Characters performing\ndemanding tasks such as engaging in combat or casting a spell may, when\nstressed, need to make DC 15 <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#concentration\">Concentration</a> checks to stay awake and not\nput themselves in a dangerous situation.\n    <p><b><a id=\"night-terrors\"></a>Night Terrors:</b>\nA sleeping character wakes after a few hours of sleep, usually screaming\nin terror. Pulse and breathing are rapid, pupils are dilated, and hair\nstands on end. The character is confused and hard to calm down. Night\nterrors are similar to ordinary nightmares, but much more intense and\ndisruptive.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"somnambulism\"></a>Somnambulism:</b>\nSleepwalking. As with night terrors, this behavior occurs in the first few\nhours of sleep. An episode may last up to 30 minutes. During the episode,\nthe character�s face is blank and staring, and she can be roused only with\ndifficulty. Once awake, she recalls nothing of the activity.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"somatoform-disorders\"></a>\nSomatoform Disorders\n    </h6>\nA somatoform disorder may be diagnosed when a character experiences\nphysical symptoms that cannot be explained by an actual physical injury or\ndisease.\n    <p><b><a id=\"somatization-disorder\"></a>Somatization Disorder:</b>\nThe character suffers from a physical ailment or diseaselike effect, with\nsymptoms ranging from dizziness and impotence to blindness and intense\npain. The <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#heal\">Heal</a> skill cannot identify any physical cause for the symptoms,\nand magical healing has no effect.

All attack rolls, saves, and checks\ntake a -2 penalty.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"conversion-disorder\"></a>Conversion Disorder:</b>\nThe character reports dysfunctions that suggest a physical disorder but,\nthough they are involuntary, the symptoms actually provide a way for the\nvictim to avoid something undesirable or a way to garner attention and\ncaring, a condition called Munchausenism. Symptoms range from painful\nheadaches to paralysis or blindness. With the condition known as Reverse\nMunchausenism, a character projects ill health onto others and may even\narrange injuries or illnesses for them so that she can thereafter take\ncare of them. All attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -2 penalty.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"hypochondriasis\"></a>Hypochondriasis:</b>\nCharacter believes she suffers from a serious disease. No physical cause\nfor reported symptoms can be found, but the character continues to believe\nthat the disease or condition exists, often with serious consequences to\nher normal life.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"body-dysmorphic-disorder\"></a>Body Dysmorphic Disorder:</b>\nCharacter suffers from perceived flaws in appearance, usually of the face,\nor of the hips or legs.

Drugs include alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine,\nhallucinogens, marijuana, nicotine, opium (especially morphine and\nheroin), sedatives, and more fantastic substances present in the campaign\nworld (see <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#sample-drugs\">Sample Drugs</a>, earlier in this section).\n    <p>\nA character under the sway of such a substance should feel the personal\nstruggle daily. Will saving throws might be used to resist or succumb\nsymbolically to cravings, especially just before periods of stress (for\nexample, just before a confrontation or likely battle with evil cultists).\nAll attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -2 morale penalty because of\nwithdrawal symptoms. Sanity losses could occur from binges or bad trips.\nSome characters might find that drugs promote communication with alien\nentities and deities, and that dreams about them become ever more vivid\nand horrifying, Conversely, such substances might function as medications,\ndeadening a character�s fears and offering temporary defenses against\nSanity loss.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"other-disorders\"></a>\nOther Disorders\n    </h6>\nOther disorders exist in common parlance, but most of these are actually\nsymptoms or specific instances of disorders already mentioned above. These\ninclude quixotism (seeing the supernatural everywhere, even in the most\nmundane surroundings), panzaism (seeing the most extraordinary events as\nordinary and rational), and megalomania (delusions of power, wealth, fame,\nand ability).
