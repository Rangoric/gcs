These categories pertain to what training is needed\nto become proficient in a weapon&#8217;s use (simple, martial, or exotic),\nthe weapon&#8217;s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance\n(ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its\nrelative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size\n(Small, Medium, or Large).</p>\n    <a id=\"simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons\"></a><p><b>Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons</b>: Anybody but a\ndruid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons.\nBarbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all\nsimple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are\nproficient with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly\nalso some martial or even exotic weapons. A character who uses a weapon\nwith which he or she is not proficient takes a &#8211;4 penalty on attack\nrolls.</p>\n    <a id=\"melee-and-ranged-weapons\"></a><p><b>Melee and Ranged Weapons</b>: Melee weapons are used for\nmaking melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged\nweapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective\nin melee.</p>\n    <a id=\"reach-weapons\"></a><p><i>Reach Weapons</i>: Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears,\nranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is\na melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren&#8217;t\nadjacent to him or her. Most reach double the wielder&#8217;s natural reach,\nmeaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can\nattack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent\nsquare. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the\nappropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not\nadjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.</p>\n    <a id=\"double-weapons\"></a><p><i>Double Weapons</i>: Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome\nhooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords\nare double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double\nweapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he or she incurs all the\nnormal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as\nthough the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light\nweapon. The character can also choose to use a double weapon two\nhanded, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double\nweapon in one hand can&#8217;t use it as a double weapon&#8212;only one end of the\nweapon can be used in any given round.</p>\n    <a id=\"thrown-weapons\"></a><p><i>Thrown Weapons</i>: Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears,\ndarts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and\nnets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength\nmodifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons).\nIt is possible to throw a weapon that isn&#8217;t designed to be thrown (that\nis, a melee weapon that doesn&#8217;t have a numeric entry in the Range\nIncrement column on Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes\na &#8211;4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon\nis a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a\nfull-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack\nscores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on\na critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>\n    <a id=\"projectile-weapons\"></a><p><i>Projectile Weapons</i>: Light crossbows, slings, heavy\ncrossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite\nlongbows, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile\nweapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific\nweapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage\nrolls with a projectile weapon unless it&#8217;s a specially built composite\nshortbow, specially built composite longbow, or sling. If the character\nhas a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she\nuses a bow or a sling.</p>\n    <a id=\"ammunition\"></a><p><i>Ammunition</i>: Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows\n(for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings). When\nusing a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action;\ncrossbows and slings require an action for reloading. Generally\nspeaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered\nuseless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being\ndestroyed or lost.</p>\n    <p>Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as\nammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or\notherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what\nhappens to them after they are thrown.</p>\n    <a id=\"light-one-handed-and-two-handed-melee-weapons\"></a><p><b>Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons</b>: This\ndesignation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon\nin combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a\ncharacter of the weapon&#8217;s size category, is considered a light weapon,\na one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.</p>\n    <a id=\"light-weapon\"></a><p><i>Light</i>: A light weapon is easier to use in one&#8217;s off\nhand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be used while grappling. A\nlight weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder&#8217;s Strength bonus (if\nany) to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it&#8217;s used\nin the primary hand, or one-half the wielder&#8217;s Strength bonus if it&#8217;s\nused in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no\nadvantage on damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon\nwere held in the wielder&#8217;s primary hand only.</p>\n    <p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.</p>\n    <a id=\"one-handed-weapon\"></a><p><i>One-Handed</i>: A one-handed weapon can be used in either\nthe primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder&#8217;s Strength bonus to\ndamage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it&#8217;s used in\nthe primary hand, or 1/2 his or her Strength bonus if it&#8217;s used in the\noff hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee\ncombat, add 1-1/2 times the character&#8217;s Strength bonus to damage rolls.</p>\n    <a id=\"two-handed-weapon\"></a><p><i>Two-Handed</i>: Two hands are required to use a two-handed\nmelee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character&#8217;s Strength\nbonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon. </p>\n    <a id=\"weapon-size\"></a><p><b>Weapon Size</b>: Every weapon has a size category. This\ndesignation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was\ndesigned.</p>\n    <p>A weapon&#8217;s size category isn&#8217;t the same as its size as an\nobject. Instead, a weapon&#8217;s size category is keyed to the size of the\nintended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size\ncategories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object\none size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is\nan object of the same size category as the wielder.</p>\n    <a id=\"inappropriately-sized-weapons\"></a><p><i>Inappropriately Sized Weapons</i>: A creature can&#8217;t make\noptimum use of a weapon that isn&#8217;t properly sized for it. A cumulative\n&#8211;2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference\nbetween the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual\nwielder. If the creature isn&#8217;t proficient with the weapon a &#8211;4\nnonproficiency penalty also applies.</p>\n    <p>The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon\n(whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed\nweapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size\ncategory of difference between the wielder&#8217;s size and the size of the\ncreature for which the weapon was designed. If a weapon&#8217;s designation\nwould be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or\ntwo-handed by this alteration, the creature can&#8217;t wield the weapon at\nall.</p>\n    <a id=\"improvised-weapons\"></a><p><b>Improvised Weapons</b>: Sometimes objects not crafted to be\nweapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not\ndesigned for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is\nconsidered to be nonproficient with it and takes a &#8211;4 penalty on attack\nrolls made with that object. To determine the size category and\nappropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size\nand damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An\nimprovised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals\ndouble damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a\nrange increment of 10 feet.</p>\n    <a id=\"weapon-qualities\"></a><h5>WEAPON QUALITIES</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Here is the format for weapon entries (given\nas column headings on Table: Weapons, below).</p>\n    <a id=\"weapon-cost\"></a><p><b>Cost</b>: This value is the weapon&#8217;s cost in gold pieces\n(gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that\ngoes with the weapon. This cost is the same for a Small or Medium\nversion of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.</p>\n    <a id=\"weapon-damage\"></a><p><b>Damage</b>: The Damage columns give the damage dealt by the\nweapon on a successful hit. The column labeled &#8220;Dmg (S)&#8221; is for Small\nweapons. The column labeled &#8220;Dmg (M)&#8221; is for Medium weapons. If two\ndamage ranges are given then the weapon is a double weapon.
