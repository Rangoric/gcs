Unlike arcane spells,\ndivine spells draw power from a divine source. Clerics gain spell power\nfrom deities or from divine forces. The divine force of nature powers\ndruid and ranger spells. The divine forces of law and good power\npaladin spells. Divine spells tend to focus on healing and protection\nand are less flashy, destructive, and disruptive than arcane spells.</p>\n    <a id=\"preparing-divine-spells\"></a><h5>PREPARING DIVINE SPELLS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Divine spellcasters prepare their spells in\nlargely the same manner as wizards do, but with a few differences. The\nrelevant ability for divine spells is Wisdom. To prepare a divine\nspell, a character must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell&#8217;s level.\nLikewise, bonus spells are based on Wisdom.</p>\n    <a id=\"preparing-divine-spells-time-of-day\"></a><p><b>Time of Day</b>: A divine spellcaster chooses and prepares\nspells ahead of time, just as a wizard does. However, a divine\nspellcaster does not require a period of rest to prepare spells.\nInstead, the character chooses a particular part of the day to pray and\nreceive spells. The time is usually associated with some daily event.\nIf some event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, he\nmust do so as soon as possible. If the character does not stop to pray\nfor spells at the first opportunity, he must wait until the next day to\nprepare spells.</p>\n    <a id=\"divine-spell-selection-and-preparation\"></a><p><b>Spell Selection and Preparation</b>: A divine spellcaster\nselects and prepares spells ahead of time through prayer and meditation\nat a particular time of day. The time required to prepare spells is the\nsame as it is for a wizard (1 hour), as is the requirement for a\nrelatively peaceful environment. A divine spellcaster does not have to\nprepare all his spells at once. However, the character&#8217;s mind is\nconsidered fresh only during his or her first daily spell preparation,\nso a divine spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or\nshe has cast a spell or abandoned a previously prepared spell.</p>\n    <p>Divine spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a\ncharacter&#8217;s spell selection is limited to the spells on the list for\nhis or her class. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers have separate\nspell lists. A cleric also has access to two domains determined during\nhis character creation. Each domain gives him access to a domain spell\nat each spell level from 1st to 9th, as well as a special granted\npower. With access to two domain spells at each spell level&#8212;one from\neach of his two domains&#8212;a cleric must prepare, as an extra domain\nspell, one or the other each day for each level of spell he can cast.\nIf a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, it can be prepared\nonly in a domain spell slot.</p>\n    <a id=\"preparing-divine-spells-and-spell-slots\"></a><p><b>Spell Slots</b>: The character class tables show how many\nspells of each level a character can cast per day.</p>\n    <p>These openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A\nspellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot\nwith a lower level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability\nscore to cast spells that would otherwise be his or her due still gets\nthe slots but must fill them with spells of lower level. </p>\n    <a id=\"preparing-divine-spells-and-recent-casting-limit\"></a><p><b>Recent Casting Limit</b>: As with arcane spells, at the\ntime of preparation any spells cast within the previous 8 hours count\nagainst the number of spells that can be prepared.</p>\n    <a id=\"spontaneous-casting-of-cure-and-inflict-spells\"></a><p><b>Spontaneous Casting of Cure and Inflict Spells</b>: A good\ncleric (or a cleric of a good deity) can spontaneously cast a cure\nspell in place of a prepared spell of the same level or higher, but not\nin place of a domain spell. An evil cleric (or a cleric of an evil\ndeity) can spontaneously cast an inflict spell in place of a prepared\nspell (one that is not a domain spell) of the same level or higher.\nEach neutral cleric of a neutral deity either spontaneously casts cure\nspells like a good cleric or inflict spells like an evil one, depending\non which option the player chooses when creating the character. The\ndivine energy of the spell that the cure or inflict spell substitutes\nfor is converted into the cure or inflict spell as if that spell had\nbeen prepared all along.</p>\n    <a id=\"spontaneous-casting-of-summon-natures-allu-spells\"></a><p><b>Spontaneous Casting of Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally Spells</b>: A\ndruid can spontaneously cast a summon nature&#8217;s ally spell in place of a\nprepared spell of the same level or higher. The divine energy of the\nspell that the summon nature&#8217;s ally spell substitutes for is converted\ninto the summon spell as if that spell had been prepared all along.</p>\n    <a id=\"divine-magical-writings\"></a><h5>DIVINE MAGICAL WRITINGS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Divine spells can be written down and\ndeciphered just as arcane spells can (see Arcane Magical Writings,\nabove). Any character with the <a href=\"SkillsAll.html#Spellcraft\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Spellcraft</a> skill can attempt to\ndecipher\nthe divine magical writing and identify it. However, only characters\nwho have the spell in question (in its divine form) on their class\nspell list can cast a divine spell from a scroll.</p>\n    <a id=\"gaining-new-divine-spells\"></a><h5>NEW DIVINE SPELLS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Divine spellcasters most frequently gain new\nspells in one of the following two ways.</p>\n    <a id=\"spells-gained-at-a-new-level\"></a><p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level</b>: Characters who can cast\ndivine spells undertake a certain amount of study between adventures.\nEach time such a character receives a new level of divine spells, he or\nshe learns new spells from that level automatically.</p>\n    <a id=\"independent-research\"></a><p><b>Independent Research</b>: A divine spellcaster also can\nresearch a spell independently, much as an arcane spellcaster can. Only\nthe creator of such a spell can prepare and cast it, unless he decides\nto share it with others.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","id","border","cellPadding","cellSpacing","style","className","href","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
