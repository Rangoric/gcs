# Generic Character Sheet

In here we have a few things going on

- We have a 3.5 SRD downloaded from [dndsrd.net](http://dndsrd.net) and turned into markdown & formatted for this site
- We have a "My SRD" which is the above and other SRD & OGL materials integrated in a pleasent fashion for my own use.
- A way to login
  - A way to view your characters created under a specific set of rules
  - A way to enter custom data for yourself to attach to a set of rules.

The custom data is meant to be a way to enter whatever you want on your character sheet. I'm toying with an idea to snapshot character sheets to share, which will "basically" allow us to not share content we aren't allowed to share.

The license file in the `/src/pages/srd` folder covers everything in that folder.
The license file in the `/src/pages/darian` folder covers everything in that folder.
The license file in _this_ folder covers everything else aside from:
- `/static/CNAME` -> This has a domain name you must change.
