At 0 hit points,\nyou&#8217;re disabled.</p>\n    <p>At from &#8211;1 to &#8211;9 hit points, you&#8217;re dying.</p>\n    <p>At &#8211;10 or lower, you&#8217;re dead.</p>\n    <a id=\"massive-damage\"></a><p><b>Massive Damage</b>: If you ever sustain a single attack\ndeals 50 points of damage or more and it doesn&#8217;t kill you outright, you\nmust make a DC 15 Fortitude save. If this saving throw fails, you die\nregardless of your current hit points. If you take 50 points of damage\nor more from multiple attacks, no one of which dealt 50 or more points\nof damage itself, the massive damage rule does not apply.</p>\n    <a id=\"disabled\"></a><h5>DISABLED (0 HIT POINTS)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When your current hit points drop to exactly\n0, you&#8217;re disabled. You can only take a single move or standard action\neach turn (but not both, nor can you take full-round actions). You can\ntake move actions without further injuring yourself, but if you perform\nany standard action (or any other strenuous action) you take 1 point of\ndamage after the completing the act. Unless your activity increased\nyour hit points, you are now at &#8211;1 hit points, and you&#8217;re dying.</p>\n    <p>Healing that raises your hit points above 0 makes you fully\nfunctional again, just as if you&#8217;d never been reduced to 0 or fewer hit\npoints.</p>\n    <p>You can also become disabled when recovering from dying. In\nthis case, it&#8217;s a step toward recovery, and you can have fewer than 0\nhit points (see Stable Characters and Recovery, below).</p>\n    <a id=\"dying\"></a><h5>DYING (&#8211;1 TO &#8211;9 HIT POINTS)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When your character&#8217;s current hit points drop\nto between &#8211;1 and &#8211;9 inclusive, he&#8217;s dying.</p>\n    <p>A dying character immediately falls unconscious and can take\nno actions.</p>\n    <p>A dying character loses 1 hit point every round. This\ncontinues until the character dies or becomes stable (see below).</p>\n    <a id=\"dead\"></a><h5>DEAD (&#8211;10 HIT POINTS OR LOWER)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When your character&#8217;s current hit points drop\nto &#8211;10 or lower, or if he takes massive damage (see above), he&#8217;s dead.\nA character can also die from taking ability damage or suffering an\nability drain that reduces his Constitution to 0.</p>\n    <a id=\"stable-characters-and-recovery\"></a><h5>STABLE CHARACTERS AND RECOVERY</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">On the next turn after a character is reduced\nto between &#8211;1 and &#8211;9 hit points and on all subsequent turns, roll d% to\nsee whether the dying character becomes stable. He has a 10% chance of\nbecoming stable. If he doesn&#8217;t, he loses 1 hit point. (A character\nwho&#8217;s unconscious or dying can&#8217;t use any special action that changes\nthe initiative count on which his action occurs.)</p>\n    <p>If the character&#8217;s hit points drop to &#8211;10 or lower, he&#8217;s dead.</p>\n    <p>You can keep a dying character from losing any more hit points\nand make him stable with a DC 15 Heal check.</p>\n    <p>If any sort of healing cures the dying character of even 1\npoint of damage, he stops losing hit points and becomes stable.</p>\n    <p>Healing that raises the dying character&#8217;s hit points to 0\nmakes him conscious and disabled. Healing that raises his hit points to\n1 or more makes him fully functional again, just as if he&#8217;d never been\nreduced to 0 or lower. A spellcaster retains the spellcasting\ncapability she had before dropping below 0 hit points.</p>\n    <p>A stable character who has been tended by a healer or who has\nbeen magically healed eventually regains consciousness and recovers hit\npoints naturally. If the character has no one to tend him, however, his\nlife is still in danger, and he may yet slip away.</p>\n    <a id=\"recovering-with-help\"></a><p><b>Recovering with Help</b>: One hour after a tended, dying\ncharacter becomes stable, roll d%. He has a 10% chance of becoming\nconscious, at which point he is disabled (as if he had 0 hit points).\nIf he remains unconscious, he has the same chance to revive and become\ndisabled every hour. Even if unconscious, he recovers hit points\nnaturally. He is back to normal when his hit points rise to 1 or higher.</p>\n    <a id=\"recovering-without-help\"></a><p><b>Recovering without Help</b>: A severely wounded character\nleft alone usually dies. He has a small chance, however, of recovering\non his own. </p>\n    <p>A character who becomes stable on his own (by making the 10%\nroll while dying) and who has no one to tend to him still loses hit\npoints, just at a slower rate. He has a 10% chance each hour of\nbecoming conscious. Each time he misses his hourly roll to become\nconscious, he loses 1 hit point. He also does not recover hit points\nthrough natural healing.</p>\n    <p>Even once he becomes conscious and is disabled, an unaided\ncharacter still does not recover hit points naturally. Instead, each\nday he has a 10% chance to start recovering hit points naturally\n(starting with that day); otherwise, he loses 1 hit point.</p>\n    <p>Once an unaided character starts recovering hit points\nnaturally, he is no longer in danger of naturally losing hit points\n(even if his current hit point total is negative).</p>\n    <a id=\"healing\"></a><h5>HEALING</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">After taking damage, you can recover hit\npoints through natural healing or through magical healing. In any case,\nyou can&#8217;t regain hit points past your full normal hit point total.</p>\n    <a id=\"natural-healing\"></a><p><b>Natural Healing</b>: With a full night&#8217;s rest (8 hours of\nsleep or more), you recover 1 hit point per character level. Any\nsignificant interruption during your rest prevents you from healing\nthat night.</p>\n    <p>If you undergo complete bed rest for an entire day and night,\nyou recover twice your character level in hit points. </p>\n    <a id=\"magical-healing\"></a><p><b>Magical Healing</b>: Various abilities and spells can\nrestore hit points.</p>\n    <a id=\"healing-limits\"></a><p><b>Healing Limits</b>: You can never recover more hit points\nthan you lost. Magical healing won&#8217;t raise your current hit points\nhigher than your full normal hit point total.</p>\n    <a id=\"healing-ability-damage\"></a><p><b>Healing Ability Damage</b>: Ability damage is temporary,\njust as hit point damage is. Ability damage returns at the rate of 1\npoint per night of rest (8 hours) for each affected ability score.\nComplete bed rest restores 2 points per day (24 hours) for each\naffected ability score.</p>\n    <a id=\"temporary-hit-points\"></a><h5>TEMPORARY HIT POINTS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Certain effects give a character temporary hit\npoints. When a character gains temporary hit points, note his current\nhit point total. When the temporary hit points go away the character&#8217;s\nhit points drop to his current hit point total. If the character&#8217;s hit\npoints are below his current hit point total at that time, all the\ntemporary hit points have already been lost and the character&#8217;s hit\npoint total does not drop further.</p>\n    <p>When temporary hit points are lost, they cannot be restored as\nreal hit points can be, even by magic.</p>\n    <a id=\"increases-in-constitution-score-and-current-hit-points\"></a><p><b>Increases in Constitution Score and Current Hit Points</b>:\nAn increase in a character&#8217;s Constitution score, even a temporary one,\ncan give her more hit points (an effective hit point increase), but\nthese are not temporary hit points. They can be restored and they are\nnot lost first as temporary hit points are.</p>\n    <a id=\"nonlethal-damage\"></a><h5>NONLETHAL DAMAGE</h5>\n    <a id=\"dealing-nonlethal-damage\"></a><p className=\"initial\"><b>Dealing Nonlethal Damage</b>: Certain\nattacks deal nonlethal damage. Other effects, such as heat or being\nexhausted, also deal nonlethal damage. When you take nonlethal damage,\nkeep a running total of how much you&#8217;ve accumulated. <i>Do not deduct\nthe nonlethal damage number from your current hit points</i>. It is not\n&#8220;real&#8221; damage. Instead, when your nonlethal damage equals your current\nhit points, you&#8217;re staggered, and when it exceeds your current hit\npoints, you fall unconscious. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether the nonlethal\ndamage equals or exceeds your current hit points because the nonlethal\ndamage has gone up or because your current hit points have gone down.</p>\n    <a id=\"nonlethal-damage-with-a-weapon-that-deals-lethal-damage\"></a><p><i>Nonlethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Lethal Damage</i>:\nYou can use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal\ndamage instead, but you take a &#8211;4 penalty on your attack roll.</p>\n    <a id=\"lethal-damage-with-a-weapon-that-deals-nonlethal-damage\"></a><p><i>Lethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Nonlethal Damage</i>:\nYou can use a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, including an unarmed\nstrike, to deal lethal damage instead, but you take a &#8211;4 penalty on\nyour attack roll.</p>\n    <a id=\"staggered-and-unconscious\"></a><p><b>Staggered and Unconscious</b>: When your nonlethal damage\nequals your current hit points, you&#8217;re staggered. You can only take a\nstandard action or a move action in each round. You cease being\nstaggered when your current hit points once again exceed your nonlethal\ndamage.</p>\n    <p>When your nonlethal damage exceeds your current hit points,\nyou fall unconscious. While unconscious, you are helpless.</p>\n    <p>Spellcasters who fall unconscious retain any spellcasting\nability they had before going unconscious.</p>\n    <a id=\"healing-nonlethal-damage\"></a><p><b>Healing Nonlethal Damage</b>: You heal nonlethal damage at\nthe rate of 1 hit point per hour per character level.</p>\n    <p>When a spell or a magical power cures hit point damage, it\nalso removes an equal amount of nonlethal damage.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
