</table>\n    <p><i>First Aid</i>: You usually use first aid to save a <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>dying</a> character. If a character\nhas negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per\nround, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#stable\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>stable</a>. A stable character\nregains no hit points but stops losing them.</p>\n    <p><i>Long-Term Care</i>: Providing long-term care means treating\na wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful,\nthe patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to\nability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a\nfull 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full\nday of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest\nin a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.\nYou can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items\nand supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in\nsettled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the\nhealer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.</p>\n    <p><i>Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones</i>:\nA creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal\nspeed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.</p>\n    <p>A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell\nmust succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by\none-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10\nminutes to dress the victim&#8217;s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check\nagainst the spell&#8217;s save DC.</p>\n    <p><i>Treat Poison</i>: To treat poison means to tend a single\ncharacter who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage\nfrom the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned\ncharacter makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal\ncheck. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her\nsaving throw, whichever is higher.</p>\n    <p><i>Treat Disease</i>: To treat a disease means to tend a\nsingle diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw\nagainst disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character\nuses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or\ntreating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a\ncreature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10\nminutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light\nactivity.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. Generally speaking, you can&#8217;t try a\nHeal check again without proof of the original check&#8217;s failure. You can\nalways retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the\nprevious attempt is still alive.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: A character with the <a href=\"featsAll.html#self-sufficient\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Self-Sufficient</a>\nfeat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.</p>\n    <p>A healer&#8217;s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal\nchecks.</p>\n    <h5>LISTEN (WIS)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: Your Listen check is either made\nagainst a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that you might hear,\nor it is opposed by your target&#8217;s <a href=\"skillsAll.html#move-silently\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Move\nSilently</a> check.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Listen DC</th>\n          <th>Sound</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td align=\"center\">&#8211;10</td>\n          <td>A battle</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td align=\"center\">0</td>\n          <td>People talking<sup>1</sup></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td align=\"center\">5</td>\n          <td>A person in medium armor walking at a slow pace (10\nft./round) trying not to make any noise.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td align=\"center\">10</td>\n          <td>An unarmored person walking at a slow pace (15\nft./round) trying not to make any noise</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td align=\"center\">15</td>\n          <td>A 1st-level rogue using Move Silently to sneak past the\nlistener</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td align=\"center\">15</td>\n          <td>People whispering<sup>1</sup></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td align=\"center\">19</td>\n          <td>A cat stalking</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\" align=\"center\">30</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">An owl gliding in for a kill</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"2\" align=\"center\">1 <i>If you beat the DC by\n10 or more, you can make out what&#8217;s being said, assuming that you\nunderstand the language.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <table style={{\n      \"marginTop\": \"0.5em\"\n    }} border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"130px\"\n          }}>Listen DC Modifier</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"150px\"\n          }}>Condition</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td align=\"center\">+5</td>\n          <td>Through a door</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td align=\"center\">+15</td>\n          <td>Through a stone wall</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td align=\"center\">+1</td>\n          <td>Per 10 feet of distance</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\" align=\"center\">+5</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Listener distracted</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the\ntable could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the\nindicated DC would be their average check result. </p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear\nsomething in a reactive manner (such as when someone makes a noise or\nyou move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without using an\naction. Trying to hear something you failed to hear previously is a\nmove action.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can try to hear something that you\nfailed to hear previously with no penalty.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: When several characters are listening to the\nsame thing, a single 1d20 roll can be used for all the individuals&#8217;\nListen checks.</p>\n    <p>A <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#fascinated\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>fascinated</a> creature takes a &#8211;4\npenalty on Listen checks made as reactions.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#alertness\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Alertness</a> feat, you get a +2\nbonus on Listen checks.</p>\n    <p>A ranger gains a bonus on Listen checks when using this skill\nagainst a favored enemy.</p>\n    <p>An elf, gnome, or halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Listen\nchecks. </p>\n    <p>A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Listen checks.</p>\n    <p>A sleeping character may make Listen checks at a &#8211;10 penalty.\nA successful check awakens the sleeper.</p>\n    <h5>PROFESSION (WIS; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession\nis actually a number of separate skills. You could have several\nProfession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a\nseparate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or\nmaking an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation\nrequiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. </p>\n    <p><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent\nliving, earning about half your Profession check result in gold pieces\nper week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your\ntrade, how to perform the profession&#8217;s daily tasks, how to supervise\nhelpers, and how to handle common problems.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Not applicable. A single check generally\nrepresents a week of work.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill\nto earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly\nwage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a\nweek to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt\nto accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.</p>\n    <p><b>Untrained</b>: Untrained laborers and assistants (that is,\ncharacters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver\npiece per day.</p>\n    <h5>SENSE MOTIVE (WIS)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: A successful check lets you\navoid being bluffed (see the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#bluff\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Bluff</a> skill). You can also use\nthis skill to determine when &#8220;something is up&#8221; (that is, something odd\nis going on) or to assess someone&#8217;s trustworthiness. </p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"150px\"\n          }}>Task</th>\n          <th>Sense Motive DC</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Hunch</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">20</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Sense enchantment</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">25 or 15</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Discern secret message</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">Varies</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p><i>Hunch</i>: This use of the skill involves making a gut\nassessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from\nanother&#8217;s behavior that something is wrong, such as when you&#8217;re talking\nto an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is\ntrustworthy.</p>\n    <p><i>Sense Enchantment</i>: You can tell that someone&#8217;s behavior\nis being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a\nmind-affecting effect), even if that person isn&#8217;t aware of it. The\nusual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see dominate person),\nthe DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target&#8217;s\nactivities.</p>\n    <p><i>Discern Secret Message</i>: You may use Sense Motive to\ndetect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill.\nIn this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of\nthe character transmitting the message. For each piece of information\nrelating to the message that you are missing, you take a &#8211;2 penalty on\nyour Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that\nsomething hidden is being communicated, but you can&#8217;t learn anything\nspecific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you\nintercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you\ndon&#8217;t detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you\ninfer some false information.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Trying to gain information with Sense Motive\ngenerally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening\ntrying to get a sense of the people around you.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: No, though you may make a Sense Motive check\nfor each Bluff check made against you.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks\nwhen using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#negotiator\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Negotiator</a> feat, you get a +2\nbonus on Sense Motive checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive,\nyou get a +2 bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#diplomacy\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Diplomacy</a> checks.</p>\n    <h5>SPOT (WIS)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: The Spot skill is used primarily\nto detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot\ncheck is opposed by the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#hide\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Hide</a> check of the creature\ntrying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn&#8217;t intentionally hiding\nbut is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary\nto notice it.</p>\n    <p>A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become\naware of an <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>invisible</a> creature near you,\nthough you can&#8217;t actually see it.</p>\n    <p>Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the\nDisguise skill), and to read lips when you can&#8217;t hear or understand\nwhat someone is saying.</p>\n    <p>Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at\nwhich an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending\non the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an\nadditional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is\ndistracted (not concentrating on being observant).</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"150px\"\n          }}>Condition</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n            \"width\": \"100px\"\n          }}>Penalty</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Per 10 feet of distance</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">&#8211;1</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Spotter distracted</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\" align=\"center\">&#8211;5</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p><i>Read Lips</i>: To understand what someone is saying by\nreading lips, you must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see\nhim or her speak, and understand the speaker&#8217;s language. (This use of\nthe skill is language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases\nfor complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line\nof sight to the lips being read.</p>\n    <p>If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general\ncontent of a minute&#8217;s worth of speaking, but you usually still miss\ncertain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can&#8217;t read the\nspeaker&#8217;s lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, you draw some\nincorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in\nthis case, so that you don&#8217;t know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot\nsomething in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using\nan action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a\nmove action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute\nbefore making a Spot check, and you can&#8217;t perform any other action\n(other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can try to spot something that you\nfailed to see previously at no penalty.

For getting along in the wild or for\ngaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a\nSurvival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies\nuntil the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural\nhazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for\none. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid\na specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can\nretry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of\nsearching.</p>\n    <p><b>Restriction</b>: While anyone can use Survival to find\ntracks (regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the\ntask is 10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat)\ncan use Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you\ncan automatically determine where true north lies in relation to\nyourself.</p>\n    <p>A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this\nskill to find or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#self-sufficient\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Self-Sufficient</a> feat, you get a\n+2 bonus on Survival checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you\nget a +2 bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Knowledge</a> (nature) checks.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you\nget a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a\n+2 bonus on Survival checks in aboveground natural environments\n(aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, and plains).</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get\na +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to\navoid natural hazards.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get\na +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href=\"skillsAll.html#search\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Search</a>, you get a +2 bonus on\nSurvival checks to find or follow tracks.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
