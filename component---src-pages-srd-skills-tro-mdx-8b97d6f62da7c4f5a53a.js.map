The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard\ntexts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.</p>\n    <p>If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a\npiece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent).

Disabling (or rigging or\njamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and\ncomplex devices have higher DCs.</p>\n    <p>If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by\n4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more,\nsomething goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you&#8217;re\nattempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but\nit still works normally.</p>\n    <p>You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon\nwheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time\nlater (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"70px\"\n          }}>Device</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"80px\"\n          }}>Time</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"140px\"\n          }}>Disable Device DC<sup>1</sup></th>\n          <th>Example</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Simple</td>\n          <td>1 round</td>\n          <td>10</td>\n          <td>Jam a lock</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Tricky</td>\n          <td>1d4 rounds</td>\n          <td>15</td>\n          <td>Sabotage a wagon wheel</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Difficult</td>\n          <td>2d4 rounds</td>\n          <td>20</td>\n          <td>Disarm a trap, reset a trap</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Wicked</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">2d4 rounds</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">25</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Disarm a complex trap, cleverly\nsabotage a clockwork device</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"4\">1 <i>If you attempt to leave behind no\ntrace of your tampering, add 5 to the DC.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: The amount of time needed to make a Disable\nDevice check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple\ndevice takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or\ncomplex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. You can retry if you have missed the\ncheck by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you have failed in\norder to try again.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#nimble-fingers\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Nimble\nFingers</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable Device checks.</p>\n    <p>A rogue who beats a trap&#8217;s DC by 10 or more can study the\ntrap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her\ncompanions) without disarming it.</p>\n    <p><b>Restriction</b>: Rogues (and other characters with the\ntrapfinding class feature) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap\ngenerally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create\nit.</p>\n    <p>The spells fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and\nteleportation circle also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a\nsuccessful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike stones,\nhowever, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not\nsucceed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>\n    <h6>Other Ways to Beat a Trap</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">It&#8217;s possible to ruin many traps without\nmaking a Disable Device check.</p>\n    <p><b>Ranged Attack Traps</b>: Once a trap&#8217;s location is known,\nthe obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism&#8212;assuming the\nmechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it&#8217;s possible to plug up the\nholes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap\nfrom firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through\nthe plugs.</p>\n    <p><b>Melee Attack Traps</b>: These devices can be thwarted by\nsmashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above.\nAlternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might\nbe able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who\nis doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4\ndodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the\nnext minute.</p>\n    <p><b>Pits</b>: Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the\ntrapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a\nmakeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the\nDisable Device skill.

If the animal is\nwounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the\nDC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task\nor trick on its next action.</p>\n    <p><i>&#8220;Push&#8221; an Animal</i>: To push an animal means to get it to\nperform a task or trick that it doesn&#8217;t know but is physically capable\nof performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a\nforced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep\ncycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or\nability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds,\nthe animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>\n    <p><i>Teach an Animal a Trick</i>: You can teach an animal a\nspecific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal\ncheck against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of\n1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an\nIntelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible\ntricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily\nlimited to, the following.</p>\n    <p>Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may\npoint to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and\nit will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids,\nmonstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to\nattack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and\naberrations) counts as two tricks.</p>\n    <p>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally\nwould not do so.</p>\n    <p>Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend\nyou if no threat is present), even without any command being given.\nAlternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other\ncharacter.</p>\n    <p>Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise\nbacks down. An animal that doesn&#8217;t know this trick continues to fight\nuntil it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its\nopponent is defeated.</p>\n    <p>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do\nnot point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.</p>\n    <p>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others\nfrom approaching.</p>\n    <p>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places\nwhere it normally wouldn&#8217;t go.</p>\n    <p>Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple\ntricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</p>\n    <p>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around\nfor anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p>\n    <p>Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to\nreturn. It does not challenge other creatures that come by,</p>\n    <p>though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>\n    <p>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it.\n(This requires the animal to have the scent ability)</p>\n    <p>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy\nload.</p>\n    <p><i>Train an Animal for a Purpose</i>: Rather than teaching an\nanimal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general\npurpose. Essentially, an animal&#8217;s purpose represents a preselected set\nof known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or\nheavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all\ntricks included in the training package. If the package includes more\nthan three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p>\n    <p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though\nif the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and\nbeyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training\nan animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual\ntricks does, but no less time. </p>\n    <p>Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into\ncombat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel.\nTraining an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also\n&#8220;upgrade&#8221; an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding\nby spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal\ncheck. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the\nanimal&#8217;s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and\nriding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they\ndon&#8217;t require any additional training for this purpose.</p>\n    <p>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows\nthe tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting\ntakes three weeks.</p>\n    <p>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks\nattack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes\nfour weeks.</p>\n    <p>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows\nthe tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two\nweeks.</p>\n    <p>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the\ntricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal\nfor hunting takes six weeks.</p>\n    <p>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows\nthe tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for\nperformance takes five weeks.</p>\n    <p>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the\ntricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three\nweeks.</p>\n    <p><i>Rear a Wild Animal</i>: To rear an animal means to raise a\nwild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler\ncan rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. A\nsuccessfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time\nit&#8217;s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Handling an animal is a move action,\nwhile pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can\nhandle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move\naction.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must\nspend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being\nhandled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the\nHandle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear,\nor train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching,\nrearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the\nremainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training.\nIf the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to\ncompletion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal\nautomatically fails.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: You can use this skill on a creature with an\nIntelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any\nsuch check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks\nknown as animals do.</p>\n    <p>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle\nAnimal checks involving her animal companion. In addition, a druid&#8217;s or\nranger&#8217;s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don&#8217;t\ncount against the normal limit on tricks known and don&#8217;t require any\ntraining time or Handle Animal checks to teach.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#animal-affinity\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Animal Affinity</a> feat, you get a\n+2 bonus on Handle Animal checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal,\nyou get a +2 bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#ride\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Ride</a> checks and wild empathy\nchecks.</p>\n    <p><b>Untrained</b>: If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you\ncan use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you\ncan&#8217;t teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in\nHandle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal\ncompanion, but she can&#8217;t teach, rear, or train other nondomestic\nanimals.</p>\n    <h5>KNOWLEDGE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Like the Craft and Profession skills,\nKnowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge\nrepresents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even\nscientific discipline.</p>\n    <p>Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane\nsymbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</li>\n      <li>Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts,\nbridges, fortifications)</li>\n      <li>Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</li>\n      <li>Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</li>\n      <li>History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of\ncities)</li>\n      <li>Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs,\ntraditions, humanoids)</li>\n      <li>Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants,\nseasons and cycles, weather, vermin)</li>\n      <li>Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees,\nmottoes, personalities)</li>\n      <li>Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic\ntradition, holy symbols, undead)</li>\n      <li>The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral\nPlane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the\nplanes)</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><b>Check</b>: Answering a question within your field of study\nhas a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions),\nor 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>\n    <p>In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and\ntheir special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a\ncheck equals 10 + the monster&#8217;s HD. A successful check allows you to\nremember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5\npoints by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another\npiece of useful information.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge\ncheck doesn&#8217;t take an action&#8212;you simply know the answer or you don&#8217;t.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: No. The check represents what you know, and\nthinking about a topic a second time doesn&#8217;t let you know something\nthat you never learned in the first place.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge\n(arcana), you get a +2 bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#spellcraft\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Spellcraft</a> checks.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and\nengineering), you get a +2 bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#search\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Search</a> checks made to find\nsecret doors or hidden compartments.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get\na +2 bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#survival\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Survival</a> checks made to keep\nfrom getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a\n+2 bonus on bardic knowledge checks.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2\nbonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#gather-information\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Gather Information</a> checks.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a\n+2 bonus on Survival checks made in aboveground natural environments\n(aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, or plains).</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and\nroyalty), you get a +2 bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#diplomacy\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Diplomacy</a> checks.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a\n+2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get\na +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you\nget a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.</p>\n    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on\nKnowledge (nature) checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Untrained</b>: An untrained Knowledge check is simply an\nIntelligence check.

If you use masterwork thieves&#8217; tools, you\ngain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>\n    <p><b>Check</b>: The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40,\ndepending on the quality of the lock, as given on the table below.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"125px\"\n          }}>Lock</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"35px\"\n          }}>DC</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"125px\"\n          }}>Lock</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"35px\"\n          }}>DC</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Very simple lock</td>\n          <td>20</td>\n          <td>Good lock</td>\n          <td>30</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Average lock</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">25</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Amazing lock</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">40</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Opening a lock is a full-round action.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#nimble-fingers\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Nimble\nFingers</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on Open Lock checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Untrained</b>: You cannot pick locks untrained, but you\nmight successfully force them open.</p>\n    <h5>PROFESSION (WIS; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession\nis actually a number of separate skills. You could have several\nProfession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a\nseparate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or\nmaking an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation\nrequiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. </p>\n    <p><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent\nliving, earning about half your Profession check result in gold pieces\nper week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your\ntrade, how to perform the profession&#8217;s daily tasks, how to supervise\nhelpers, and how to handle common problems.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Not applicable. A single check generally\nrepresents a week of work.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill\nto earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly\nwage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a\nweek to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt\nto accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.</p>\n    <p><b>Untrained</b>: Untrained laborers and assistants (that is,\ncharacters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver\npiece per day.</p>\n    <h5>SLEIGHT OF HAND (DEX; TRAINED ONLY; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check\nlets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat\nof legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10\nunless an observer is determined to note where the item went.</p>\n    <p>When you use this skill under close observation, your skill\ncheck is opposed by the observer&#8217;s <a href=\"skillsAll.html#spot\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Spot</a> check. The observer&#8217;s\nsuccess doesn&#8217;t prevent you from performing the action, just from doing\nit unnoticed.</p>\n    <p>You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an\neasily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand\ncrossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the\nSpot check of anyone observing you or the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#search\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Search</a>\ncheck of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a\n+4 bonus on the Search check, since it&#8217;s generally easier to find such\nan object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light\nweapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to\nconceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken,\nor ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal\nit, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus\non the check. Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn&#8217;t\nprovoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n    <p>If you try to take something from another creature, you must\nmake a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a\nSpot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand\ncheck result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent\nwho succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether\nyou got the item.</p>\n    <p>You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as\nthough you were using the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#perform\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Perform</a> skill.

You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if\nyou&#8217;ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail\nby 9 or less, you can&#8217;t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more,\nyou suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released\nbut it doesn&#8217;t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are\nthat the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical\nenergy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you.

In this case, your effective\nlevel in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result\nminus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of\nanother class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class\nfeature.
