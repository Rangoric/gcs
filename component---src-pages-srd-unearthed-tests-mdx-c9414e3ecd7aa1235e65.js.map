prerequisites: skill ranks, specific\nfeats, and other game statistics. But the master of the assassins� guild\ndoesn�t really know whether you have 4 ranks in the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#disguise\">Disguise</a> skill. He�d\nbe at least as impressed with your ability to disguise yourself if you had\na sky-high Charisma, <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"featsAll.html#skill-focus\">Skill Focus</a> (Disguise) and 5 ranks in <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#bluff\">Bluff</a>, a <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"magicItemsWI.html#hat-of-disguise\">hat of\ndisguise</a>, or the supernatural ability to change shape (possessed by the\n    <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"monstersDitoDo.html#doppelganger\">doppelganger</a> and the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"monstersOtoR.html#rakshasa\">rakshasa</a>, among others). Similarly, no one in the\ngame world can tell whether a potential <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"dwarvenDefender.html\">dwarven defender</a> has the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"featsAll.html#toughness\">Toughness</a>\nfeat or not. Prerequisites that rely on game statistics rather than\nvisible �realities� of the game world can break the verisimilitude of the\nworld in your imagination.\n    <p>\nTo make prerequisites seem more �real,� this variant changes them to\nactual tests that would be observable in the game world. The assassins�\nguild, for example, might require potential members to sneak past the\ncastle guards (employing <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillAll.html#hide\">Hide</a> and <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#move-silently\">Move Silently</a>), infiltrate the queen�s\nbanquet (using <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#disguise\">Disguise</a>), and poison the wine of a minor noble (thus\nkilling someone for no other reason than to join the assassins). It\ncertainly helps to have 4 ranks in Disguise and 8 ranks each in Hide and\nMove Silently, but the observable result is what the assassins judge.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTest-based prerequisites have two big advantages. First, they encourage\ncharacter variety and player cleverness. Any PC who wants to become an\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"arcaneArcher.html\">arcane archer</a> can dream up a dozen ways to gain an edge in the �Twelve\nArrow Challenge� competition, and maybe he succeeds even if he has a base\nattack bonus of only +5. It�s entirely arbitrary to keep out a would-be\narcane archer who has a Dexterity of 20 but accept an archer with a\nDexterity of 13 and the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#weapon-focus\">Weapon Focus</a> (longbow) feat. The first character\nis a much better archer, and the prestige class should recognize that. The\nsecond advantage to test-based prerequisites is that they help immerse the\nplayer in the game world. It�s more exciting if a would-be <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"hierophant.html\">hierophant�s</a>\ngoal is �I want to earn a Pact with the Heavens� rather than �I need 15\nranks in <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (religion).�\n    </p>\n    <p>\nBecause the existence of a test implies that there�s an NPC administering\nthe test, these new prerequisites work best if the prestige classes in\nyour campaign are tied to specific organizations. For feats, test-based\nprerequisites work best if PCs must train as described in the DMG (and\nthus find an instructor) to get new feats.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nEmploying test-based prerequisites means that a character taking a test\nspends some time at the gaming table trying to earn access to the prestige\nclass or feat. If a test is elaborate or timeconsuming, the other players\nat the game table might get bored. A short single-player session before or\nafter the main game session is often a good way to take care of a test.\nAnother risk with a test-based prerequisite is that it relies at least to\na degree on the fall of the dice. If a player with her heart set on\nbecoming a <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"loremaster.html\">loremaster</a> has a run of bad luck during the Examination of\nIneffable Lore, she might resent the extra obstacle you�ve placed in her\ncharacter�s way. Conversely, a lucky set of die rolls can potentially give\na PC access to a prestige class or feat much earlier than would otherwise\nbe possible.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"behind-the-curtain-test-based-prerequisites\"></a>\nBEHIND THE CURTAIN: TEST-BASED PREREQUISITES\n    </h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>\nSo why don�t all prestige classes employ test-based prerequisites? It�s a\nmatter of control that highlights a fundamental difference between the job\nof the game designer and the job of the GM. The d20 rules use the\nprerequisites they do because they�re based on predictable numbers. No\ncharacter can have a base attack bonus higher than her character level,\nfor example, or more ranks in a skill than her character level + 3. For\nthe game designer, that predictability is an important balancing tool,\nensuring that no character gets access to a prestige class or feat so\nearly that it makes the game less fun.\n      <p>\nBut as the GM, you don�t have to have to worry about millions of possible\ncharacters, just the specific ones in your campaign. You can predict your\nplayers better than anyone else, both in terms of what appeals to them and\nwhat means they use to achieve those ends. And you are the architect of\nthe game world. If a PC becomes an <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"eldritchKnight.html\">eldritch knight</a> by �cheating� on the\nentrance test, the knights might kick him out and update their test to\nclose the loophole � just as a real-world organization would.\n      </p></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"pretige-class-tests\"></a>\nPRESTIGE CLASS TESTS\n    </h5>\nThe following tests are examples of test-based prerequisites for the\nstandard prestige classes. Because this variant relies heavily on the\nguiding hand of the GM, these tests won�t be appropriate in all campaigns.\n    <p><b><a id=\"arcane-archer\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"arcaneArcher.html\">Arcane Archer</a>:</b>\nThe Test of the Twelve Arrows. The applicant must cast magic weapon on the\nprovided bow, then take twelve +1 arrows into a specially tended part of\nthe forest. Before night falls, she must slay a wild boar, use magic to\ncapture an owl, and bring down the albino stag without hitting any of the\nother stags in the herd. The applicant fails if the tasks aren�t completed\nby nightfall or if she runs out of arrows.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"arcane-trickster\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"arcaneTrickster.html\">Arcane Trickster</a>:</b>\nFleece the Police. First, the applicant must intentionally get arrested\nfor unlawful magic use, displaying his flashiest spells while the arcane\ntricksters watch him surreptitiously. That night in jail, the applicant\nreceives a confusing, seemingly contradictory map, which he must figure\nout (<a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#decipher-script\">Decipher Script</a> DC 17). The relevant parts of the map show the layout\nof the precinct building. If the applicant can escape, he is welcomed into\nthe ranks of the arcane tricksters. This test is made more difficult by\nthe fact that the guards take away all the applicant�s gear.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"archmage\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"archmage.html\">Archmage</a>:</b>\nThe Counterspell Test of Sol'atur. An archmage visits the applicant\nunannounced and proposes a counterspell battle. The archmage casts 5th-,\n6th-, and 7th-level spells from all eight schools, and the applicant must\nsuccessfully identify and <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"magicOverview.html#counterspelling\">counter</a> as many as he can. To be accepted among\nthe archmages, the applicant must have a perfect score on identification\nand must successfully counter at least one 7th-level spell and one spell\nfrom each of at least five different schools.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"assassin\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"assassin.html\">Assassin</a>:</b>\nThe Test of <i>Theku et Rhasett</i>��Eliminate, then replace.� Contacted by an\nanonymous letter, the applicant is given the name of a well-known\nfunctionary in the noble court, often the chamberlain, troubadour, or\ncourt wizard. The applicant must sneak into the castle on the night of the\nfull moon, kill the target, and then impersonate him. The test is a\nsuccess if the applicant walks out of the castle disguised as the target\nwhen the gates open in the morning, carrying the target�s head in a\nsatchel.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"blackguard\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"blackguard.html\">Blackguard</a>:</b>\nBreak the Weapon, Bind the Contract. Below the palace is a chamber\nforgotten by most: the prison of Thazill, a bearded devil of unsurpassed\nevil. A would-be applicant must slip past the clay golem that wanders the\nprison complex and convince Thazill to agree to a nonlethal duel. Thazill\nis fascinated with questions of mortal faith, so even a basic\nunderstanding of religion (<a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> [religion] DC 12) impresses him\ngreatly. Thazill wields a glaive, and anyone who can break it has earned\nthe right to call himself a blackguard.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"dragon-disciple\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"dragonDisciple.html\">Dragon Disciple</a>:</b>\nRitual of Essence Distillation. Fundamentally, becoming a dragon disciple\nis a question of heritage. But a ritual exists that, when performed\nproperly, can awaken the blood of one�s draconic heritage. Performing the\n12-hour ritual requires the ability to speak Draconic and a successful DC\n18 <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (arcana) check. At three points during the ritual, the\napplicant must release some of his stored magical energy (expend a spell\nslot, in other words).\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"duelist\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"duelist.html\">Duelist</a>:</b>\nCrossed Swords at Noon. This one�s simple � to become a duelist, you have to\nbeat an existing duelist in a fair duel before a crowd in the town square.\nBut the duelists are in on a secret that the applicant usually isn�t: The\nbattle may be won with blades, but the duelists are judging the\napplicant�s worthiness based on the acclaim of the crowd. The battle is to\nsurrender, not death, and the NPC duelist surrenders when reduced to\none-third of her hit points or less.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"dwarven-defender\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"dwarvenDefender.html\">Dwarven Defender</a>:</b>\nThe Tunnel of Implacable Stone. The dwarven defenders take the applicant\ndeep into the bowels of the earth, give him his weapon of choice (but no\nother gear), and order him to start a timed run up a steeply sloping\ntunnel to the surface. Along the way, he faces a series of fights with\nprogressively larger <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersEtoF.html#earth-elemental\">earth elementals</a>, but after each fight, he earns a\npiece of equipment: first armor, then a shield, then perhaps a healing\npotion, and so on. Between fights, the applicant must run uphill, striving\nfor the surface. If he survives the fights with the elementals and makes\nit out of the tunnel in time, he becomes a dwarven defender.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"eldritch-knight\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"eldritchKnight.html\">Eldritch Knight</a>:</b>\nTourney of the Grand Eagle. Every year, the eldritch knights have a\ntwo-day tournament in a tent city they magically create outside the city\nwalls. On the first day, applicants go through an archery contest, a duel\nwith swords, and another duel using a melee weapon of each applicant�s\nchoosing. (The duels are to unconsciousness, and clerics are on hand to\nheal the gravely wounded.) On the second day, applicants engage in a\nseries of spellcasting duels � everything from fights between summoned\nmonsters to games of counter spelling one-upsmanship. Using a complex\nscoring system, the eldritch knights select two applicants to join their\norder at sunset of the second day.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"hierophant\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"hierophant.html\">Hierophant</a>:</b>\nPact with the Heavens (or Depths).

It�s an open-book, open-magic\ntest � without restrictions on the means the applicant may use to solve the\nriddle posed by the loremasters. When the applicant returns with the\ncorrect answer, the loremasters reveal that they didn�t know the answer\nthemselves, then congratulate the applicant on her original contribution\nto their accumulated store of knowledge.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"mystic-theurge\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"mysticTheurge.html\">Mystic Theurge</a>:</b>\nJourney of the Two Tests. The applicant must travel to a far-off city to\nstudy at a particular arcanists� college, passing their examination with a\nDC 16 <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (arcana) check. Then the applicant goes to the\nmountain-top Citadel of the Theurges, where he meditates and learns from\nthe priests there. Finally, he receives a divine vision in which a\nrepresentative of his deity or alignment questions him about matters\nof faith (answering correctly requires a DC 16 Knowledge [religion]\ncheck).\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"shadowdancer\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"shadowdancer.html\">Shadowdancer</a>:</b>\nAudition in Darkness. On a dimly lit stage in an abandoned theater, the\napplicant must dance well enough to impress the judges sitting unseen in\nthe audience (a DC 15 <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#perform\">Perform</a> [dance] check). Even if she passes the dance\naudition, she hears a cry of �Get her!� and dozens of guards rush the\nstage. She must escape the labyrinthine theater any way she can, employing\nstealth and combat prowess. She isn�t allowed to attack the guards\ndirectly, but she can make ripostes (attacks of opportunity, in other\nwords) if she gets the chance. If she gets out of the theater, she�s\nwelcomed into the troupe of shadowdancers with a great revel.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"thaumaturgist\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"thaumaturgist.html\">Thaumaturgist</a>:</b>\nDuel of the Servants. After calling a planar ally, the would-be\nthaumaturgist visits the vine-covered ruins of an ancient temple. A\nhigh-level thaumaturgist meets the applicant and his ally there, then\nbegins casting his own <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsPtoR.html#lesser-planar-ally\">lesser planar ally</a> spell. During the 10 minutes it\ntakes the thaumaturgist to cast his spell, the applicant can cast whatever\nspells he wishes on his own planar ally. Then the allies of the\nthaumaturgist and the applicant battle. The thaumaturgist�s ally yields\nwhen reduced to 20% or less of its full normal hit points. If the\napplicant�s ally wins, he�s eligible to join the ranks of the\nthaumaturgists.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"feat-tests\"></a>\nFEAT TESTS\n    </h5>\nThe tests described below are examples of what an instructor might demand\nfrom a PC before teaching a particular feat. As with the prestige class\ntests above, they won�t be appropriate for all campaigns.\n    <p>\nNot every feat with a prerequisite has a test associated with it, because\nmany of the requirements are either very simple (base attack bonus of +1,\nfor example), or they are tied to a specific tree of feats (<a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#power-attack\">Power Attack</a>\nis a prerequisite for <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#cleave\">Cleave</a>, for example). The best candidates for feat\ntests are feats at the top of their respective feat trees (those that have\nother feats as prerequisites but are not themselves prerequisites) and\nfeats available only to higher-level characters, because those feats\nrepresent specialized training that only the most accomplished can hope to\ncomplete.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"great-cleave\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"featsAll.html#great-cleave\">Great Cleave</a>:</b>\nTest of the Death-Dealer. The applicant must run headlong into battle\nagainst a numerically superior foe (often goblins, kobolds, or low-level\nsoldiers), using his <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"featsAll.html#cleave\">Cleave</a> feat in 3 consecutive rounds and dropping a\nsecond foe on at least two of those occasions. That performance\nsufficiently impresses the instructor, who offers to teach the applicant\nGreat Cleave.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"greater-two-weapon-fighting\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"featsAll.html#greater-two-weapon-fighting\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</a>:</b>\nTempest of Steel.

The trainer sets up an array of cadavers or\nbutcher�s meat swinging from ropes. The applicant must strike each one a\nsingle time, aiming for a particularly vulnerable point (AC 20). The\ntrainer accepts any applicants who can hit at least six of the targets\nover the course of 4 rounds. Magic weapons aren�t allowed.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"improved-precise-shot\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"featsAll.html#imrpoved-precise-shot\">Improved Precise Shot</a>:</b>\nTest of the Shield Maiden. The applicant must hit an elusive, armored\ntarget (AC 24 because it�s using the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"actionsInCombat.html#total-defence\">total defense</a> action) without hitting\nthe shield-wielding assistant who stands between the applicant and the\ntarget.

The applicant must hit seven out of nine bullseye\ntargets (AC 18) mounted on the back of wagons 30 feet away, and she has\nonly 3 rounds to do so. Any sort of magical assistance is acceptable,\nexcept for <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsHtoL.html#haste\">haste</a> spells and weapons with the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"magicItemsAW.html#speed\">speed</a> special ability.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"shoot-on-the-run\"></a><a style={{\n          \"color\": \"black\"\n        }} href=\"featsAll.html#shoot-on-the-run\">Shot on the Run</a>:</b>\nGauntlet of Cudgels. The applicant must move down the middle of a 120-foot\nlong path lined on both sides with cudgel-wielding soldiers. At the end of\nthe path is a target (AC 10), which the applicant must hit with four\narrows or other projectiles before 30 seconds pass.

That�s a\nuseful starting point for tests you might design based on published\nprestige classes or high-level feats: Imagine what kinds of activities\nwould be significantly easier for characters who possess the relevant feat\nor other attribute defined as a prerequisite.\n    <p>\nFor prestige classes based on organizations you�ve designed yourself, you\nhave a lot more freedom. Answer this question: What would impress the\nleader of the organization enough to offer membership? Then construct a\ntest just as the leader would, making it hard enough to keep membership\nfairly exclusive. Consider how applicants might bend or break the rules of\nthe test � both as the leader and as the GM. Anything the leader would\nreasonably anticipate works its way into the rules of the test. If you see\na potential �cheat� that the leader of the organization wouldn�t\nanticipate, then either design a completely different test or leave the\nloophole open � whichever is more likely to lead to an interesting story.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTry to keep tests fairly simple, because they�re essentially solo affairs.\nYou don�t want to leave the rest of the PCs waiting impatiently while one\ncharacter works his way through a test. As an exception, you can design a\ntest so complex or difficult that the relevant PC can�t complete it\nalone � the rest of the PCs must help, and completing the test becomes a\nfull-fledged adventure. This technique works best when partnered with\nother rewards (usually treasure or the chance to do a good deed or settle\nan old score) for the PCs who aren�t taking a test.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor example, you could design a multiple-part riddle for a would-be\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"loremaster.html\">loremaster</a> that takes the PCs from the city to an ancient, ruined temple,\nthen to a planar city where they must bargain with an <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"monstersG.html#efreeti\">efreeti</a> lord.\nThe wizard PC gets the chance to become a loremaster, the cleric PC can\nreclaim the temple for his deity, the rogue gets a chance to sneak into\nthe treasure vaults of the efreet, and the fighter gets out of the city,\nwhere he�s wanted for a murder he didn�t commit. Everyone has a motivation\nto help the wizard with her riddle.\n    </p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","id","style","href","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
