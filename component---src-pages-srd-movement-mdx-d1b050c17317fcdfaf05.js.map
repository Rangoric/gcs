If you do nothing but move (that is, if you use both of your\nactions in a round to move your speed), you can move double your speed.\nIf you spend the entire round running, you can move quadruple your\nspeed.

Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares\nof movement. (Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts\nas 3 squares.) You can&#8217;t run or charge across difficult terrain.</p>\n    <p>If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can\nmove only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p>\n    <p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult\nterrain.</p>\n    <a id=\"obstacles\"></a><p><b>Obstacles</b>: Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper\nmovement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn&#8217;t completely block\nit each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2\nsquares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the barrier, in\naddition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you\ndon&#8217;t have sufficient movement to cross the barrier and move into the\nsquare on the other side, you can&#8217;t cross the barrier. Some obstacles\nmay also require a skill check to cross.</p>\n    <p>On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A\ncharacter can&#8217;t move through a blocking obstacle.</p>\n    <p>Flying and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles.</p>\n    <a id=\"squeezing\"></a><p><b>Squeezing</b>: In some cases, you may have to squeeze into\nor through an area that isn&#8217;t as wide as the space you take up. You can\nsqueeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your\nnormal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it\nwere 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space you take a &#8211;4\npenalty on attack rolls and a &#8211;4 penalty to AC.</p>\n    <p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares)\nsqueezes into a space that&#8217;s one square wide, the creature&#8217;s miniature\nfigure occupies two squares, centered on the line between the two\nsquares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the\narea it squeezes into.</p>\n    <p>A creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it\ncan&#8217;t end its movement in an occupied square.</p>\n    <p>To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space&#8217;s\nwidth, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You can&#8217;t attack while\nusing Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take\na &#8211;4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n    <a id=\"special-movement-rules\"></a><h6>Special Movement Rules</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">These rules cover special movement situations.</p>\n    <a id=\"accidentally-ending-movement-in-an-illegal-space\"></a><p><b>Accidentally Ending Movement in an Illegal Space</b>:\nSometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space\nwhere it&#8217;s not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature\nin the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position,\nif there&#8217;s a legal position that&#8217;s closer.</p>\n    <a id=\"double-movement-cost\"></a><p><b>Double Movement Cost</b>: When your movement is hampered in\nsome way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square\nof movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each\ndiagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares (just as two\ndiagonal moves normally do).</p>\n    <p>If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as\n4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is\ndoubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if\ndiagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two\ndoublings are equivalent to a tripling.</p>\n    <a id=\"minimum-movement\"></a><p><b>Minimum Movement</b>: Despite penalties to movement, you\ncan take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any\ndirection, even diagonally. (This rule doesn&#8217;t allow you to move\nthrough impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited.)\nSuch movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the\ndistance covered, this move isn&#8217;t a 5-foot step).</p>\n    <a id=\"big-and-little-creatures-in-combat\"></a><h5>BIG AND LITTLE CREATURES IN COMBAT</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Creatures smaller than Small or larger than\nMedium have special rules relating to position. </p>\n    <a id=\"tiny-diminutive-and-fine-creatures\"></a><p><b>Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures</b>: Very small\ncreatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more\nthan one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature\ntypically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into\na single square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures\ncan fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square\nof space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can&#8217;t\nreach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent&#8217;s square to\nattack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the\nopponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you\ncan attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach,\nthey do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them\nwithout provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can&#8217;t flank an\nenemy.</p>\n    <a id=\"large-huge-gargantuan-and-colossal-creatures\"></a><p><b>Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures</b>: Very\nlarge creatures take up more than 1 square.</p>\n    <p>Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a\nnatural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets\neven if they aren&#8217;t in adjacent squares.</p>\n    <p>Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with\ngreater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens\nsquares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural\nreach usually gets an attack of opportunity against you if you approach\nit, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach\nbefore you can attack it. (This attack of opportunity is not provoked\nif you take a 5-foot step.)</p>\n    <p>Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to\ndouble their natural reach but can&#8217;t strike at their natural reach or\nless. </p>\n    <a id=\"table-creature-size-and-scale\"></a><p><b>Table: Creature Size and Scale</b></p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Creature Size</th>\n          <th>Space<sup>1</sup></th>\n          <th>Natural Reach<sup>1</sup></th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Fine</td>\n          <td>1/2 ft.</td>\n          <td>0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Diminutive</td>\n          <td>1 ft.</td>\n          <td>0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Tiny</td>\n          <td>2-1/2 ft.</td>\n          <td>0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Small</td>\n          <td>5 ft.</td>\n          <td>5 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Medium</td>\n          <td>5 ft.</td>\n          <td>5 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Large (tall)</td>\n          <td>10 ft.</td>\n          <td>10 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Large (long)</td>\n          <td>10 ft.</td>\n          <td>5 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Huge (tall)</td>\n          <td>15 ft.</td>\n          <td>15 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Huge (long)</td>\n          <td>15 ft.</td>\n          <td>10 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Gargantuan (tall)</td>\n          <td>20 ft.</td>\n          <td>20 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Gargantuan (long)</td>\n          <td>20 ft.</td>\n          <td>15 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Colossal (tall)</td>\n          <td>30 ft.</td>\n          <td>30 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Colossal (long)</td>\n          <td>30 ft.</td>\n          <td>20 ft.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"3\">1 <i>These values are typical for\ncreatures of the indicated size.
