Others are item creation feats,\nwhich allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A\nmetamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater\neffect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it\nactually is.</p>\n    <a id=\"fighter-bonus-feats\"></a><h5>FIGHTER BONUS FEATS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Any feat designated as a fighter feat can be\nselected as a fighter&#8217;s bonus feat. This designation does not restrict\ncharacters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that\nthey meet any prerequisites.</p>\n    <a id=\"item-creation-feats\"></a><h5>ITEM CREATION FEATS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">An item creation feat lets a spellcaster\ncreate a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items\nthey involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features\nin common.</p>\n    <a id=\"item-creation-xp-cost\"></a><p><b>XP Cost</b>: Experience that the spellcaster would normally\nkeep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of\nthe cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much\nXP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining\nenough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on\ncreating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.</p>\n    <a id=\"item-creation-raw-materials-cost\"></a><p><b>Raw Materials Cost</b>: The cost of creating a magic item\nequals one-half the sale cost of the item.</p>\n    <p>Using an item creation feat also requires access to a\nlaboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character\ngenerally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual\ncircumstances apply.</p>\n    <a id=\"item-creation-time\"></a><p><b>Time</b>: The time to create a magic item depends on the\nfeat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.</p>\n    <a id=\"item-creation-item-cost\"></a><p><b>Item Cost</b>: Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll\ncreate items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of\nthese items depends on their caster level&#8212;that is, a spell from such an\nitem has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that\nlevel. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of\nthe raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level\nmust be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the\nspell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the\ncaster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a\nconstant, as shown below:</p>\n    <dl>\n      <dd><i>Scrolls</i>: Base price = spell level x caster level x\n25 gp.</dd>\n      <dd><i>Potions</i>: Base price = spell level x caster level x\n50 gp.</dd>\n      <dd><i>Wands</i>: Base price = spell level x caster level x 750\ngp.</dd>\n    </dl>\n    <p>A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for\nthe purpose of this calculation.</p>\n    <a id=\"item-creation-extra-costs\"></a><p><b>Extra Costs</b>: Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a\nspell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a\ncommensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the\nmaterial component or pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a\nwand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or\npay fifty times the XP cost.</p>\n    <p>Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material\ncomponents or XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>\n    <a id=\"metamagic-feats\"></a><h5>METAMAGIC FEATS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">As a spellcaster&#8217;s knowledge of magic grows,\nshe can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the ways\nin which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and\ncasting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to\nmetamagic feats, at least it is possible. Spells modified by a\nmetamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not\nchange the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it\ndoes not go up.</p>\n    <a id=\"metamagic-feats-wizards-and-divine-spellcasters\"></a><p><b>Wizards and Divine Spellcasters</b>: Wizards and divine\nspellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation,\nthe character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and\nthus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).</p>\n    <a id=\"metamagic-feats-sorcerers-and-bards\"></a><p><b>Sorcerers and Bards</b>: Sorcerers and bards choose spells\nas they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether\nto apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other\nspellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. But\nbecause the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic\nform in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot.\nTherefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a\nmetamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast\na regular spell. If the spell&#8217;s normal casting time is 1 action,\ncasting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or\nbard. (This isn&#8217;t the same as a 1-round casting time.) For a spell with\na longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the\nspell.</p>\n    <a id=\"spontaneous-casting-and-metamagic-feats\"></a><p><b>Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats</b>: A cleric\nspontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell can cast a metamagic\nversion of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case.\nCasting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round\naction, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra\nfull-round action to cast.</p>\n    <a id=\"effects-of-metamagic-feats-on-a-spell\"></a><p><b>Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell</b>: In all ways, a\nmetamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is\nprepared and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications\nare not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description. The\nmodifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by\nthe feat user. A spellcaster can&#8217;t use a metamagic feat to alter a\nspell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.</p>\n    <p>Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don&#8217;t\neliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while\nthreatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not\nprovoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n    <p>Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the\nspecific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can&#8217;t\nmodify.</p>\n    <a id=\"multiple-metamagic-feats-on-a-spell\"></a><p><b>Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell</b>: A spellcaster can\napply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level\nare cumulative. You can&#8217;t apply the same metamagic feat more than once\nto a single spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"magic-items-and-metamagic-spells\"></a><p><b>Magic Items and Metamagic Spells</b>: With the right item\ncreation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a\nscroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to\nthe spell&#8217;s higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic\nfeat). A character doesn&#8217;t need the metamagic feat to activate an item\nstoring a metamagic version of a spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"counterspelling-metamagic-spells\"></a><p><b>Counterspelling Metamagic Spells</b>: Whether or not a\nspell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its\nvulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another\nspell.</p>\n    <a id=\"feats-descriptions\"></a><h3>FEAT DESCRIPTIONS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Here is the format for feat descriptions.</p>\n    <a id=\"feat-name-type-of-feat\"></a><h5>FEAT NAME [TYPE OF FEAT]</h5>\n    <a id=\"feat-prerequisite\"></a><p className=\"initial\"><b>Prerequisite</b>: A minimum ability score,\nanother feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of\nranks in one or more skills, or a class level that a character must\nhave in order to acquire this feat.
