</table>\nRacial variants are a great way add diversity to your game without\ndrastically changing the ecology of your world. One method of altering\nthe existing races is to introduce environmental variants, a number of\nwhich are presented here.\n    <p> You may decide that one or more of these variants represent\nthe &ldquo;standard&rdquo; version of a given race in your world. For\nstance, in a desert-based campaign the desert races presented below\ncould replace the normal versions of the races.\n    </p>\n    <p> Alternatively, these variants could coexist with the standard\nraces (or even with other variants) in your world. For example, you can\nuse them as world-building tools&mdash;the existence of racial\noffshoots may constitute living proof of an ancient racial migration in\nresponse to some disaster.\n    </p>\n    <p> Each racial variant modifies the race to which it is applied\n(hereafter called the standard race) in minor ways. All racial traits\nof the standard race &mdash; racial skill bonuses, bonus feats, special\nsensory capabilities (such as darkvision and low-light vision), ability\nmodifiers, combat bonuses against specific foes, and racial weapon\nproficiencies &mdash; are retained unless the variant specifies\notherwise. For instance, a human retains his extra skill points and\nextra feat at 1st level, a dwarf retains his stonecunning ability, and\nan elf retains her ability to spot secret doors, unless the variant\ndescription specifically indicates otherwise.\n    </p>\n    <p> Many of the variant races described in this section provide\nalternate ability score adjustments. In these cases, the adjustments\ngiven here supersede the standard race's adjustments. For example, the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }} href=\"#aquatic-goblin\">aquatic goblin's</a> ability score adjustments are -2 Strength, +2 Constitution, and -2 Charisma. These adjustments take the place of the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }} href=\"monstersG.html#goblin\">goblin's</a> normal -2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, and -2 Charisma.\n    </p>\n    <p> Because humans are, by nature, the most adaptable of races,\nenvironmental variants are generally not included for humans. The\nexception is <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }} href=\"#aquatic-humans\">aquatic humans</a>,\nwhich, due to their ability to live and breathe underwater, are\nsufficiently different from other humans to warrant an environmental\nvariant.\n    </p>\n    <h2><a id=\"aquatic-races\"></a>Aquatic Races</h2>\nBeneath the surface of the ocean lies an exotic and a alien world,\ncomplete with canyons, mountains, volcanoes, and forests. Inky depths\nconceal sunken cities, sleeping deities, and titanic monsters. For\nresidents of the aquatic realm, the sunny world of the air is as\nmysterious and unknown as the black depths of the sea.\n    <p> Players wanting their characters to be ocean dwellers can use\nthese variants. Or, their characters might encounter these races while\njourneying beneath the sea.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThe following cultural attributes are common to most aquatic races.\n    </p>\n    <h6>Personality</h6>\nAn aquatic race usually shares the temperament and interests of the\nstandard race, but its members tend to be more serene than their\nlandborn cousins.\n    <h6>Physical Description</h6>\nA water creature is taller and thinner than a standard member of her\nrace. Her feet and hands are webbed to facilitate swimming. (<a style={{\n      \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n    }} href=\"#aquatic-elves\">Aquatic elves</a>\neven have fins along their limbs that serve the same purpose.) A water\ncreature's skin ranges from pale green to dark blue. Her hair usually\nmatches her skin color but may be one or two shades darker.\n    <p> Water dwellers wear very little clothing, and what they do\nwear tends to cling tightly to their bodies. Some favor jewelry made of\ncoral and other undersea treasures.\n    </p>\n    <h6>Relations</h6>\nThe attitudes of water creatures tend to be very similar to those of\ntheir landborn cousins. Members of aquatic races generally treat\nlandborn creatures with guarded pleasantness on the rare occasions when\nthey meet.\n    <h6>Alignment</h6>\nHaving avoided most of the political, economic, and military turmoil of\nthe surface world, water creatures tend to take a much more placid view\nof life than their landborn cousins do. Members of an aquatic race\nfavor neutrality in at least one aspect of alignment, if not both.\n    <h6>Lands</h6>\nThe civilizations of water dwellers often mirror those of their\nstandard races, though water folk favor more loosely organized\ngovernments and more open societies. Water creatures generally have\nplenty of space available for building, so they rarely structure their\nhabitats as densely populated cities. Instead, undersea races prefer to\nmaintain loosely defined territories in which families and individuals\ncan carve out their own niches.\n    <h6>Religion</h6>\nWater creatures usually pay homage to at least one deity related to\noceans, storms, or nature. Otherwise, their worshiping habits are\nsimilar to those of their standard races.\n    <h6>Language</h6>\nWater creatures speak any languages spoken by members of their standard\nrace. Many also learn Aquan to facilitate communication with other\nunderwater creatures.\n    <h6>Adventurers</h6>\nWhile there are plenty of adventures to be found beneath the waves,\nwater creatures occasionally venture onto land to fulfill some\nimportant goal. Some are lured by the alien ways of the surface people,\nothers feel a wanderlust that can be tamed only by walking the earth.\n    <h4><a id=\"aquatic-racial-traits\"></a>General Aquatic Racial Traits</h4>\n    <p>\nAll aquatic races have the following racial traits.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Aquatic: An aquatic race gains the <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n        }} href=\"monsterTypes.html#aquatic\">aquatic subtype</a>.\nAn aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air\nunless it also has the amphibious special quality. An aquatic creature\ncan hold its breath outside the water for 2 rounds per point of\nConstitution. After that, it begins to suffocate.</li>\n      <li>Swim speed: An aquatic creature always has a swim speed. It can move through water at its swim speed without making <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n        }} href=\"skillsAll.html#swim\">Swim</a>\nchecks. It has a 8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some\naction or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim\ncheck, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action\nwhile swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</li>\n      <li>Bonus Language: Aquan. Aquatic races are familiar with the language of water-based creatures.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h4><a id=\"aquatic-race-level-adjustment\"></a>Aquatic Race Level Adjustments</h4>\nNone of the aquatic races have level adjustments when your entire campaign is set underwater and all the PCs have the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n    }} href=\"monsterTypes.html#aquatic\">aquatic subtype</a>,\nor when playing a nonaquatic campaign. The advantages gained by an\naquatic character when in an aquatic environment even out with those of\nother aquatic characters, and their disadvantages in nonaquatic\nenvironments make up for any advantages they might enjoy.\n    <p> However, when a mix of aquatic and nonaquatic characters\noccurs in an aquatic or ship-based campaign, aquatic characters enjoy a\ndistinct advantage over their land-based cousins. In this case,\nconsider applying a +1 level adjustment for all aquatic races, due to\ntheir swim speed, improved low-light vision or darkvision, and other\nspecial abilities.\n    </p>\n    <h3><a id=\"aquatic-dwarves\"></a>AQUATIC DWARVES</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\nBeneath the waves, dwarves remain the masters of stone.

Settlements cluster around sources of heat, including hot springs and\nvolcanic vents. Frozen in the ice are relics of a forgotten, warmer time. Strange\ncreatures descend from the glaciers, wreaking havoc and drawing adventurers like\nbeacons.\n    <p>\nPlayers wanting their characters to be nonhuman arctic dwellers can build characters\nusing these variants, or their characters could encounter these races while journeying\nacross the ice and snow.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThe following cultural attributes are common to most arctic races.\n    </p>\n    <h6>Personality</h6>\nNearly all ice dwellers are more grim and humorless than members of their standard\nraces. Efficiency in word and deed is crucial to survival in the harsh arctic\nrealms, so arctic creatures tend to get straight to the point in conversation,\nand they have little patience for those who speak in riddles or half truths. Because\nthey must struggle for even the most basic existence in the severe climate of\nthe arctic regions, excess of any kind is offensive to them. Thus, they tend to\nbe frugal and to value hard work for the benefit of all over individual accomplishment.\n    <h6>Physical Description</h6>\nAn ice dweller is hardier than a member of his standard race, and he tends to\ncarry extra weight on his frame even when in exceptional physical condition. His\nskin can be any shade from pale white to light blue, and his hair and eyes can\nbe of any color found among members of his standard race.\n    <p>\nArctic creatures wear many layers of clothing as protection against the intense\ncold of their homeland. They do not particularly value jewelry or other ornamentation,\nand they carry only what they need to survive,\n    </p>\n    <h6>Relations</h6>\nThose who spend their lives in the bleak and comfortless arctic regions treat\noutsiders with guarded wariness, if not outright distrust. Though members of most\narctic tribes are willing to welcome strangers in from the cold, they tend to\nwatch such newcomers very closely and hurry them on their way as soon as possible.\nOf course, a stranger with a particularly useful skill may be invited to stay &mdash; it\nis difficult to turn away a strong back or a skilled toolmaker in the desolate\nand frigid lands where the arctic races make their homes.\n    <p>\nIn addition to their particular distrust of outsiders, members of arctic races\ntend to harbor many of the same prejudices held by their standard races.\n    </p>\n    <h6>Alignment</h6>\nArctic races are generally inclined toward the alignment preferences of their\nstandard races.\n    <h6>Lands</h6>\nIt is difficult for any living thing to survive in the frozen wastelands where\narctic races live. Thus, most other races know little or nothing of their arctic\ncousins, and what they do know is often tainted by legend and hearsay. Most arctic\ncreatures make their homes in ice caves or beneath the ground, although some tribes\nhave adapted to life on the surface by building ice houses and other structures\nthat can survive fierce winter storms.\n    <h6>Religion</h6>\nArctic races worship deities typical of their standard races.\n    <h6>Adventurers</h6>\nIce dwellers must exert themselves merely to survive in the bitter climate of\ntheir homelands, so they tend to make ideal adventurers. Those who dislike the\nconstant struggle of life in the arctic often travel far from their homes in search\nof comfort, if not adventure. Occasionally, arctic tribes send emissaries into\ntemperate lands to gather aid against particularly strong enemies or to secure\nemergency stores during hard times.\n    <h4><a id=\"arctic-racial-trait\"></a>General Arctic Racial Trait</h4>\nAll arctic races have the following racial trait.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Cold Endurance: Members of arctic races have a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude\nsaves made to resist the effects of <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n        }} href=\"wildernessAndEnvironment.html#cold-dangers\">cold weather or exposure</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3><a id=\"arctic-dwarves\"></a>ARCTIC DWARVES</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\nIn the icy wastes, dwarves are the masters of both ice and stone.
