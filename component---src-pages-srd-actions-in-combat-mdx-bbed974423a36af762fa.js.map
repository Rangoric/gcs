A round\npresents an opportunity for each character involved in a combat\nsituation to take an action.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nEach round�s activity begins with the character with the highest\ninitiative result and then proceeds, in order, from there. Each\nround of a combat uses the same initiative order. When a\ncharacter�s turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that\ncharacter performs his entire round�s worth of actions. (For\nexceptions, see Attacks of Opportunity and Special Initiative\nActions.)\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor almost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a\nround or the beginning of a round. A round can be a segment of\ngame time starting with the first character to act and ending with\nthe last, but it usually means a span of time from one round to\nthe same initiative count in the next round. Effects that last a\ncertain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count\nthat they began on.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"action-types\"></a>\n      <p>{`ACTION TYPES`}</p>\n    </h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">\nAn action�s type essentially tells you how long the action takes\nto perform (within the framework of the 6-second combat round) and\nhow movement is treated. There are four types of actions: standard\nactions, move actions, full-round actions, and free actions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIn a normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move\naction, or you can perform a full-round action. You can also\nperform one or more free actions. You can always take a move\naction in place of a standard action.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIn some situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be\nlimited to taking only a single move action or standard action.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"standard-action\"></a>\n      <b>Standard Action</b>: A standard action allows you to do\nsomething, most commonly make an attack or cast a spell. See\nTable: Actions in Combat for other standard actions.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"move-action\"></a>\n      <b>Move Action</b>: A move action allows you to move your speed or\nperform an action that takes a similar amount of time. See Table:\nActions in Combat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nYou can take a move action in place of a standard action. If you\nmove no actual distance in a round (commonly because you have\nswapped your move for one or more equivalent actions), you can\ntake one 5-foot step either before, during, or after the action.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"full-round-action\"></a>\n      <b>Full-Round Action</b>: A full-round action consumes all your\neffort during a round. The only movement you can take during a\nfull-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or after the\naction. You can also perform free actions (see below).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSome full-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSome full-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only\nin situations when you are limited to performing only a standard\naction during your round. The descriptions of specific actions,\nbelow, detail which actions allow this option.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"free-action\"></a>\n      <b>Free Action</b>: Free actions consume a very small amount of\ntime and effort. You can perform one or more free actions while\ntaking another action normally. However, there are reasonable\nlimits on what you can really do for free.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"not-an-action\"></a>\n      <b>Not an Action</b>: Some activities are so minor that they are\nnot even considered free actions. They literally don�t take any\ntime at all to do and are considered an inherent part of doing\nsomething else.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"restricted-activity\"></a>\n      <b>Restricted Activity</b>: In some situations, you may be unable\nto take a full round�s worth of actions. In such cases, you are\nrestricted to taking only a single standard action or a single\nmove action (plus free actions as normal). You can�t take a\nfull-round action (though you can start or complete a full-round\naction by using a standard action; see below).\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"table-actions-in-combat\"></a>\n

An\nunarmed attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity from other\nfoes nor does it provoke an attack of opportunity from an unarmed\nfoe.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAn unarmed character can�t take attacks of opportunity (but see\n&#8220;Armed&#8221; Unarmed Attacks, below).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>&#8220;Armed&#8221; Unarmed Attacks</i>: Sometimes a character�s or\ncreature�s unarmed attack counts as an armed attack. A monk, a\ncharacter with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, a spellcaster\ndelivering a touch attack spell, and a creature with natural\nphysical weapons all count as being armed. Note that being armed\ncounts for both offense and defense (the character can make\nattacks of opportunity)\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"unarmed-strike-damage\"></a>\n      <i>Unarmed Strike Damage</i>: An unarmed strike from a Medium\ncharacter deals 1d3 points of damage (plus your Strength modifier,\nas normal). A Small character�s unarmed strike deals 1d2 points of\ndamage, while a Large character�s unarmed strike deals 1d4 points\nof damage.

The hit might be a\ncritical hit (or �crit�). To find out if it�s a critical hit, you\nimmediately make a critical roll � another attack roll with all the\nsame modifiers as the attack roll you just made. If the critical\nroll also results in a hit against the target�s AC, your original\nhit is a critical hit. (The critical roll just needs to hit to\ngive you a crit. It doesn�t need to come up 20 again.) If the\ncritical roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA critical hit means that you roll your damage more than once,\nwith all your usual bonuses, and add the rolls together. Unless\notherwise specified, the threat range for a critical hit on an\nattack roll is 20, and the multiplier is x2.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"critical-hit-exception\"></a>\n      <i>Exception</i>: Extra damage over and above a weapon�s normal\ndamage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"increased-threat-range\"></a>\n      <i>Increased Threat Range</i>: Sometimes your threat range is\ngreater than 20.

If you�re\ngagged or in the area of a silence spell, you can�t cast such a\nspell. A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to\nspoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has a verbal\ncomponent.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTo cast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture\nfreely with at least one hand. You can�t cast a spell of this type\nwhile bound, grappling, or with both your hands full or occupied.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTo cast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine focus\n(DF) component, you have to have the proper materials, as\ndescribed by the spell. Unless these materials are elaborate\npreparing these materials is a free action. For material\ncomponents and focuses whose costs are not listed, you can assume\nthat you have them if you have your spell component pouch.\n    </p>\nSome spells have an experience point (XP) component and entail\nan experience point cost to you. No spell can restore the lost XP.\nYou cannot spend so much XP that you lose a level, so you cannot\ncast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you may,\non gaining enough XP to achieve a new level, immediately spend the\nXP on casting the spell rather than keeping it to advance a level.\nThe XP are expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the\ncasting succeeds.\n    <p><a id=\"concentration\"></a>\n      <b>Concentration</b>: You must concentrate to cast a spell. If you\ncan�t concentrate you can�t cast a spell. If you start casting a\nspell but something interferes with your concentration you must\nmake a Concentration check or lose the spell. The check�s DC\ndepends on what is threatening your concentration (see the\nConcentration skill). If you fail, the spell fizzles with no\neffect. If you prepare spells, it is lost from preparation. If you\ncast at will, it counts against your daily limit of spells even\nthough you did not cast it successfully.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>Concentrating to Maintain a Spell</b>: Some spells require\ncontinued concentration to keep them going. Concentrating to\nmaintain a spell is a standard action that doesn�t provoke an\nattack of opportunity. Anything that could break your\nconcentration when casting a spell can keep you from concentrating\nto maintain a spell. If your concentration breaks, the spell ends.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"casting-time\"></a>\n      <b>Casting Time</b>: Most spells have a casting time of 1 standard\naction. A spell cast in this manner immediately takes effect.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"casting-a-spell-and-attacks-of-opportunity\"></a>\n      <b>Attacks of Opportunity</b>: Generally, if you cast a spell, you\nprovoke attacks of opportunity from threatening enemies. If you\ntake damage from an attack of opportunity, you must make a\nConcentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + spell level)\nor lose the spell. Spells that require only a free action to cast\ndon�t provoke attacks of opportunity.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"casting-on-the-defensive\"></a>\n      <b>Casting on the Defensive</b>: Casting a spell while on the\ndefensive does not provoke an attack of opportunity. It does,\nhowever, require a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to\npull off. Failure means that you lose the spell.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"touch-spells-in-combat\"></a>\n      <b>Touch Spells in Combat</b>: Many spells have a range of touch.\nTo use these spells, you cast the spell and then touch the\nsubject, either in the same round or any time later. In the same\nround that you cast the spell, you may also touch (or attempt to\ntouch) the target. You may take your move before casting the\nspell, after touching the target, or between casting the spell and\ntouching the target. You can automatically touch one friend or use\nthe spell on yourself, but to touch an opponent, you must succeed\non an attack roll.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"touch-attacks\"></a>\n      <i>Touch Attacks</i>: Touching an opponent with a touch spell is\nconsidered to be an armed attack and therefore does not provoke\nattacks of opportunity. However, the act of casting a spell does\nprovoke an attack of opportunity. Touch attacks come in two types:\nmelee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks. You can score\ncritical hits with either type of attack. Your opponent�s AC\nagainst a touch attack does not include any armor bonus, shield\nbonus, or natural armor bonus. His size modifier, Dexterity\nmodifier, and deflection bonus (if any) all apply normally.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"holding-the-charge\"></a>\n      <i>Holding the Charge</i>: If you don�t discharge the spell in the\nround when you cast the spell, you can hold the discharge of the\nspell (hold the charge) indefinitely. You can continue to make\ntouch attacks round after round. You can touch one friend as a\nstandard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. If\nyou touch anything or anyone while holding a charge, even\nunintentionally, the spell discharges. If you cast another spell,\nthe touch spell dissipates. Alternatively, you may make a normal\nunarmed attack (or an attack with a natural weapon) while holding\na charge. In this case, you aren�t considered armed and you\nprovoke attacks of opportunity as normal for the attack. (If your\nunarmed attack or natural weapon attack doesn�t provoke attacks of\nopportunity, neither does this attack.) If the attack hits, you\ndeal normal damage for your unarmed attack or natural weapon and\nthe spell discharges. If the attack misses, you are still holding\nthe charge.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"dismiss-a-spell\"></a><a id=\"dismiss\"></a>\n      <i>Dismiss a Spell</i>: Dismissing an active spell is a standard\naction that doesn�t provoke attacks of opportunity.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"activate-magic-item\"></a>\nActivate Magic Item\n    </h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">\nMany magic items don�t need to be activated.
