However, there are several methods by\nwhich extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical\ncreature as the foundation: by adding character classes, increasing a\nmonster&#8217;s Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods\nare not mutually exclusive&#8212;it&#8217;s possible for a monster with a template\nto be improved by both increasing its Hit Dice and adding character\nclass levels.</p>\n    <a id=\"class-levels\"></a><p><b>Class Levels</b>: Intelligent creatures that are reasonably\nhumanoid in shape most commonly advance by adding class levels.\nCreatures that fall into this category have an entry of &#8220;By character\nclass&#8221; in their Advancement line. When a monster adds a class level,\nthat level usually represents an increase in experience and learned\nskills and capabilities.</p>\n    <a id=\"increased-hit-dice\"></a><p><b>Increased Hit Dice</b>: Intelligent creatures that are not\nhumanoid in shape, and nonintelligent monsters, can advance by\nincreasing their Hit Dice. Creatures with increased Hit Dice are\nusually superior specimens of their race, bigger and more powerful than\ntheir run-of-the-mill fellows.</p>\n    <a id=\"added-templates\"></a><p><b>Templates</b>: Both intelligent and nonintelligent\ncreatures with an unusual heritage or an inflicted change in their\nessential nature may be modified with a template. Templates usually\nresult in tougher monsters with capabilities that differ from those of\ntheir common kin.</p>\n    <p>Each of these three methods for improving monsters is\ndiscussed in more detail below.</p>\n    <a id=\"ability-score-arrays\"></a><h3>ABILITY SCORE ARRAYS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Monsters are assumed to have completely\naverage (or standard) ability scores&#8212;a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as\nmodified by their racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are\nindividuals and often have better than normal ability scores, and\nusually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of\nability scores. Monsters who improve by adding a template, and monsters\nwho improve by increasing their Hit Dice, may use any of the three\narrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be\nimproved could easily be considered elite.</p>\n    <a id=\"elite-array\"></a><p><b>Elite Array</b>: The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\nWhile the monster has one weakness compared to a typical member of its\nrace, it is significantly better overall. The elite array is most\nappropriate for monsters who add levels in a player character class.</p>\n    <a id=\"nonelite-array\"></a><p><b>Nonelite Array</b>: The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10,\n9, 8. The nonelite array does not necessarily make a monster better\nthan normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with\nstrengths and weaknesses compared to a typical member of its race. The\nnonelite array is most appropriate for monsters who add class levels in\na NPC class.</p>\n    <a id=\"ability-score-improvement\"></a><p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b>: Treat monster Hit Dice the\nsame as character level for determining ability score increases. This\nonly applies to Hit Dice increases, monsters do not gain ability score\nincreases for levels they &#8220;already reached&#8221; with their racial Hit Dice,\nsince these adjustments are included in their basic ability scores.</p>\n    <a id=\"monsters-and-class-levels\"></a><h3>MONSTERS AND CLASS LEVELS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">If a creature acquires a character class, it\nfollows the rules for multiclass characters.</p>\n    <p>The creature&#8217;s Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it\nhas plus its racial Hit Dice. A creature&#8217;s &#8220;monster class&#8221; is always a\nfavored class, and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it.\nAdditional Hit Dice gained from taking levels in a character class\nnever affect a creature&#8217;s size.</p>\n    <a id=\"humanoids-and-class-levels\"></a><p><b>Humanoids and Class Levels</b>: Creatures with 1 or less HD\nreplace their monster levels with their character levels. The monster\nloses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted\nby its 1 monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills,\nfeats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level character of the\nappropriate class.</p>\n    <a id=\"level-adjustment-and-effective-character-level\"></a><p><b>Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level</b>: To\ndetermine the effective character level (ECL) of a monster character,\nadd its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class\nlevels. The monster is considered to have experience points equal to\nthe minimum needed to be a character of its ECL. </p>\n    <p>If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its\ncharacter level for purposes of determining how much equipment it can\npurchase.

The augmented subtype is always paired with the\ncreature&#8217;s original type. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the\nnew creature has the traits of the new type but the features of the\noriginal type.</p>\n    <p>If a template changes a creature&#8217;s size, use Table: Changes to\nStatistics by Size to calculate changes to natural armor, Armor Class,\nattack rolls, and grapple bonus.</p>\n    <a id=\"template-hit-dice-and-hit-points\"></a><p><b>Hit Dice and Hit Points</b>: Most templates do not change\nthe number of Hit Dice a monster has, but some do.

Of course, any change in ability scores\nmay affect attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use the\nnew modifier to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster&#8217;s size\nalso changes its attack bonus; see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.</p>\n    <a id=\"template-damage\"></a><p><b>Damage</b>: Damage changes with Strength. If the creature\nuses a two-handed weapon or has a single natural weapon, it adds 1-1/2\ntimes its Strength bonus to the damage.

Otherwise, use\nthe following guidelines.</p>\n    <a id=\"adding-class-levels\"></a><h5>ADDING CLASS LEVELS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">If you are advancing a monster by adding\nplayer character class levels, decide if the class levels directly\nimprove the monster&#8217;s existing capabilities.</p>\n    <p>When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it\ntypical ability scores appropriate for that class. Most creatures are\nbuilt using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10,\n10, adjusted by racial modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use\nthe elite array of ability scores before racial adjustments: 15, 14,\n13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with NPC classes use the nonelite array of 13,\n12, 11, 10, 9, 8. T</p>\n    <a id=\"associated-class-levels\"></a><h6>Associated Class Levels</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Class levels that increase a monster&#8217;s\nexisting strengths are known as associated class levels. Each\nassociated class level a monster has increases its CR by 1.</p>\n    <p>Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes\nfor a creature that relies on its fighting ability.</p>\n    <p>Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that\nrelies on stealth to surprise its foes, or on skill use to give itself\nan advantage. </p>\n    <p>A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature\nthat already has the ability to cast spells as a character of the class\nin question, since the monster&#8217;s levels in the spellcasting class stack\nwith its innate spellcasting ability.</p>\n    <a id=\"nonassociated-class-levels\"></a><h6>Nonassociated Class Levels</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">If you add a class level that doesn&#8217;t directly\nplay to a creature&#8217;s strength the class level is considered\nnonassociated, and things get a little more complicated. Adding a\nnonassociated class level to a monster increases its CR by 1/2 per\nlevel until one of its nonassociated class levels equals its original\nHit Dice. At that point, each additional level of the same class or a\nsimilar one is considered associated and increases the monster&#8217;s CR by\n1.</p>\n    <p>Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.</p>\n    <a id=\"adding-hit-dice\"></a><h5>ADDING HIT DICE</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When you improve a monster by adding Hit Dice,\nuse Table: Improved Monster CR Increase to determine the effect on the\ncreature&#8217;s CR. Keep in mind that many monsters that advance by adding\nHit Dice also increase in size. Do not stack this CR increase with any\nincrease from class levels. In general, once you&#8217;ve doubled a\ncreature&#8217;s CR, you should closely watch any additional increases in its\nabilities. Adding Hit Dice to a creature improves several of its\nabilities, and radical increases might not follow this progression\nindefinitely. Compare the monster&#8217;s improved attack bonus, saving throw\nbonuses, and any DCs of its special abilities from the HD increase to\ntypical characters of the appropriate level and adjust the CR\naccordingly.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-improved-monster-cr-increase\"></a><p><b>Table: Improved Monster CR Increase</b></p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Creature&#8217;s Original Type</th>\n          <th>CR Increase</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Aberration, construct, elemental, fey, giant, humanoid,\nooze, plant, undead, vermin</td>\n          <td>+1 per 4 HD added</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Animal, magical beast, monstrous humanoid</td>\n          <td>+1 per 3 HD added</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Dragon, outsider, nonassociated class levels</td>\n          <td>+1 per 2 HD or 2 levels added</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Directly associated class levels</td>\n          <td>+1 per level added</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <th>Other Modifiers:</th>\n          <th>\n          </th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Size increased to Large or larger</td>\n          <td>+1 to CR</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Monster&#8217;s ability scores based on elite array<sup>*</sup></td>\n          <td>+1 to CR</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Monster possesses special attacks or qualities that\nsignificantly improve combat effectiveness</td>\n          <td>+2 to CR</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Monster possesses special attacks or qualities that\nimprove combat effectiveness in a minor way</td>\n          <td>+1 to CR</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Template added</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">+ template CR modifier</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"2\">* <i>Do not apply this increase if you\nadvance a monster by class levels.

Large creatures gain increased\nStrength, reach, and other benefits. Apply this modifier if you\nincrease a creature beyond Medium and in conjunction with any other\nincreases.</p>\n    <p>Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size\nmay actually lose effectiveness because of a size increase. Monsters\nthat don&#8217;t benefit from size increases don&#8217;t advance in that manner for\nthis reason.</p>\n    <a id=\"adding-special-abilities\"></a><h5>ADDING SPECIAL ABILITIES</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">You can add any sort of spell-like,\nsupernatural, or extraordinary ability to a creature. As with a class\nlevel, you should determine how much, or how little, this ability adds\nto the creature&#8217;s existing repertoire. A suite of abilities that work\ntogether should be treated as a single modifier for this purpose. If\nthe ability (or combination of abilities) significantly increases the\nmonster&#8217;s combat effectiveness, increase its CR by 2. Minor abilities\nincrease the creature&#8217;s CR by 1, and truly trivial abilities may not\nincrease CR at all. If the special abilities a monster gains are not\ntied to a class or Hit Die increase, this CR increase stacks.</p>\n    <p>A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance\nof incapacitating or crippling a character in one round. A significant\nspecial quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster&#8217;s\nvulnerability to common attacks. Do not add this factor twice if a\nmonster has both special attacks and special qualities.</p>\n    <p>Make sure to &#8220;scale&#8221; your evaluation of these abilities by the\nmonster&#8217;s current CR.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","id","className","border","cellPadding","cellSpacing","style","colSpan","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
