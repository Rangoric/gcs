An affected opponent can resist the effects with a\nsuccessful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful creature&rsquo;s racial HD\n+\nfrightful creature&rsquo;s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the\ncreature&rsquo;s descriptive text).

The attack can have almost\nany\nsort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical\nrange is 30 feet, but check the creature&rsquo;s entry for details. The\ntype\nof saving throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a Will or\nFortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature&rsquo;s racial HD + gazing\ncreature&rsquo;s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the\ncreature&rsquo;s\ndescriptive text). A successful saving throw negates the effect. A\nmonster&rsquo;s gaze attack is described in abbreviated form in its\ndescription. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a\nsaving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the\ninitiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with a gaze\nattack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to\nmake the saving throw by not looking at the creature, in one of two\nways. </p>\n    <p><i>Averting Eyes</i>: The opponent avoids looking at the\ncreature&rsquo;s face, instead looking at its body, watching its\nshadow,\ntracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each round, the\nopponent has a 50% chance to not need to make a saving throw against\nthe gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains\nconcealment against that opponent.</p>\n    <p><i>Wearing a Blindfold</i>: The opponent cannot see the\ncreature at all (also possible to achieve by turning one&rsquo;s back\non the\ncreature or shutting one&rsquo;s eyes). The creature with the gaze\nattack\ngains total concealment against the opponent. </p>\n    <p>A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack\naction by choosing a target within range. That opponent must attempt a\nsaving throw but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is\npossible for an opponent to save against a creature&rsquo;s gaze twice\nduring\nthe same round, once before the opponent&rsquo;s action and once during\nthe\ncreature&rsquo;s turn. </p>\n    <p>Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents.

Unlike true\noutsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep. </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"natural-weapons\"></a>Natural Weapons</b>: Natural\nweapons are weapons that are\nphysically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee attack with\na natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke attacks of\nopportunity. Likewise, it threatens any space it can reach. Creatures\ndo not receive additional attacks from a high base attack bonus when\nusing natural weapons. The number of attacks a creature can make with\nits natural weapons depends on the type of the attack&mdash;generally,\na\ncreature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one\ngore attack, one sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large\ncreatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam attack with each\narm). Refer to the individual monster descriptions.</p>\n    <p>Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical\nhit on a natural attack roll of 20.</p>\n    <p>When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them\n(or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary weapon. All the\ncreature&rsquo;s remaining natural weapons are secondary. </p>\n    <p>The primary weapon is given in the creature&rsquo;s Attack\nentry,\nand the primary weapon or weapons is given first in the\ncreature&rsquo;s Full\nAttack entry. A creature&rsquo;s primary natural weapon is its most\neffective\nnatural attack, usually by virtue of the creature&rsquo;s physiology,\ntraining, or innate talent with the weapon. An attack with a primary\nnatural weapon uses the creature&rsquo;s full attack bonus. Attacks\nwith\nsecondary natural weapons are less effective and are made with a\n&ndash;5\npenalty on the attack roll, no matter how many there are. (Creatures\nwith the Multiattack feat take only a &ndash;2 penalty on secondary\nattacks.)\nThis penalty applies even when the creature makes a single attack with\nthe secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of\nopportunity.</p>\n    <p>Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most\ncommon are summarized below.</p>\n    <p><i>Bite</i>: The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing\npiercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.</p>\n    <p><i>Claw or Talon</i>: The creature rips with a sharp\nappendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.</p>\n    <p><i>Gore</i>: The creature spears the opponent with an antler,\nhorn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.</p>\n    <p><i>Slap or Slam</i>: The creature batters opponents with an\nappendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.</p>\n    <p><i>Sting</i>: The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing\npiercing damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in\naddition to hit point damage.</p>\n    <p><i>Tentacle</i>: The creature flails at opponents with a\npowerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing) damage.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"nonabilities\"></a>Nonabilities</b>: Some creatures\nlack certain ability\nscores. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0&mdash;they\nlack the\nability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects\nof nonabilities are detailed below.</p>\n    <p><i>Strength</i>: Any creature that can physically manipulate\nother objects has at least 1 point of Strength. A creature with no\nStrength score can&rsquo;t exert force, usually because it has no\nphysical\nbody or because it doesn&rsquo;t move. The creature automatically fails\nStrength checks. If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity\nmodifier to its base attack bonus instead of a Strength modifier.</p>\n    <p><i>Dexterity</i>: Any creature that can move has at least 1\npoint of Dexterity. A creature with no Dexterity score can&rsquo;t\nmove. If\nit can perform actions (such as casting spells), it applies its\nIntelligence modifier to initiative checks instead of a Dexterity\nmodifier. The creature automatically fails Reflex saves and Dexterity\nchecks.</p>\n    <p><i>Constitution</i>: Any living creature has at least 1 point\nof Constitution. A creature with no Constitution has no body or no\nmetabolism. It is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save\nunless the effect works on objects or is harmless. The creature is also\nimmune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain, and\nautomatically fails Constitution checks. A creature with no\nConstitution cannot tire and thus can run indefinitely without tiring\n(unless the creature&rsquo;s description says it cannot run).</p>\n    <p><i>Intelligence</i>: Any creature that can think, learn, or\nremember has at least 1 point of Intelligence. A creature with no\nIntelligence score is mindless, an automaton operating on simple\ninstincts or programmed instructions. It has immunity to mind-affecting\neffects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects)\nand automatically fails Intelligence checks.</p>\n    <p>Mindless creatures do not gain feats or skills, although they\nmay have bonus feats or racial skill bonuses.</p>\n    <p><i>Wisdom</i>: Any creature that can perceive its environment\nin any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom. Anything with no Wisdom\nscore is an object, not a creature. Anything without a Wisdom score\nalso has no Charisma score.</p>\n    <p><i>Charisma</i>: Any creature capable of telling the\ndifference between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1\npoint of Charisma.

Roll d%: On a\nfailure,\nno creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically\nreturn whence they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been\nsummoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures\nwith the ability to summon do not use it lightly, since it leaves them\nbeholden to the summoned creature. In general, they use it only when\nnecessary to save their own lives.

If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent\ntakes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to\none size category smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed\nhas various consequences, depending on the creature doing the\nswallowing. A swallowed creature is considered to be grappled, while\nthe creature that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can\ntry to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the\namount of cutting damage required to get free is noted in the creature\ndescription), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class\nof the interior of a creature that swallows whole is normally 10 + 1/2\nits natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity.

A swarm\nhas the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has\na single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier,\na single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws\nas a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made\nup of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a\nside, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order\nto attack, it moves into an opponent&rsquo;s space, which provokes an\nattack\nof opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size,\nsince it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares\noccupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the\nswarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move\nthrough cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.</p>\n    <p>A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures\nor 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of\n1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine\ncreatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not.\nSwarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could\nnormally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because\ncreatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl\nover each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms\nare represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a\nlarge swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains\nin contiguous squares.</p>\n    <p><i>Traits</i>: A swarm has no clear front or back and no\ndiscernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking.\nA swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and\npiercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is\nimmune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower\ncauses it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not\ndegrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never\nstaggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be\ntripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.</p>\n    <p>A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a\nspecific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as\ndisintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms,\ncompulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has\nan Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much\ndamage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as\nsplash weapons and many evocation spells.</p>\n    <p>Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible\nto high winds such as that created by a gust of wind spell. For\npurposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm\nas a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm\nrendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized\nand dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its\nnonlethal damage.</p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"swarm-attack\"></a>Swarm Attack</b>: Creatures with\nthe swarm subtype don&rsquo;t\nmake standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any\ncreature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no\nattack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for\nconcealment or cover. A swarm&rsquo;s statistics block has\n&ldquo;swarm&rdquo; in the\nAttack and Full Attack entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount\nof damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr valign=\"bottom\">\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"100px\"\n          }}>Swarm HD</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"100px\"\n          }}>Swarm Base Damage</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>1&ndash;5</td>\n          <td>1d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>6&ndash;10</td>\n          <td>2d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>11&ndash;15</td>\n          <td>3d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>16&ndash;20</td>\n          <td>4d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>21 or more</td>\n          <td>5d6</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>A swarm&rsquo;s attacks are nonmagical, unless the\nswarm&rsquo;s\ndescription states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a\nswarm attack&rsquo;s damage to 0, being incorporeal, and other special\nabilities usually give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to\ndamage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain,\nor other special attacks in addition to normal damage.</p>\n    <p>Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not\nmake attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they\ndistract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.</p>\n    <p><i>Distraction (Ex)</i>: Any living creature vulnerable to a\nswarm&rsquo;s damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is\nnauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarm&rsquo;s HD +\nswarm&rsquo;s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a swarm&rsquo;s\ndescription)\nnegates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the\narea of a swarm requires a <a href=\"skillsAll.html#concentration\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Concentration</a> check (DC 20 +\nspell level).\nUsing skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20\nConcentration check.</p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"telepathy\"></a>Telepathy (Su)</b>: A creature with\nthis ability can\ncommunicate telepathically with any other creature within a certain\nrange (specified in the creature&rsquo;s entry, usually 100 feet) that\nhas a\nlanguage. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once\ntelepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with\nmore than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously\nspeaking and listening to multiple people at the same time.</p>\n    <p>Some creatures have a limited form of telepathy, while others\nhave a more powerful form of the ability.</p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"trample\"></a>Trample (Ex)</b>: As a full-round\naction, a creature with\nthis special attack can move up to twice its speed and literally run\nover any opponents at least one size category smaller than itself. The\ncreature merely has to move over the opponents in its path; any\ncreature whose space is completely covered by the trampling\ncreature&rsquo;s\nspace is subject to the trample attack. If a target&rsquo;s space is\nlarger\nthan 5 feet, it is only considered trampled if the trampling creature\nmoves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves\nover only some of a target&rsquo;s space, the target can make an attack\nof\nopportunity against the trampling creature at a &ndash;4 penalty. A\ntrampling\ncreature that accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space\nreturns to the last legal position it occupied, or the closest legal\nposition, if there&rsquo;s a legal position that&rsquo;s closer.</p>\n    <p>A trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the\ncreature&rsquo;s slam\ndamage + 1-1/2 times its Str modifier). The creature&rsquo;s\ndescriptive text\ngives the exact amount.</p>\n    <p>Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but\nthese take a &ndash;4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of\nopportunity,\ntrampled opponents can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage.</p>\n    <p>The save DC against a creature&rsquo;s trample attack is 10 +\n1/2\ncreature&rsquo;s HD + creature&rsquo;s Str modifier (the exact DC is\ngiven in the\ncreature&rsquo;s descriptive text).

In most cases, a creature keeps\nvaluables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it\ntravels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such\nas magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at\nhome. Treasure can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures can have\nvarying amounts of each, as follows.</p>\n    <p><i>Standard</i>: Refer to the treasure tables and roll d% once\nfor each type of treasure (Coins, Goods, Items) on the Level section of\nthe table that corresponds to the creature&rsquo;s Challenge Rating\n(for\ngroups of creatures, use the Encounter Level for the encounter\ninstead). Some creatures have double, triple, or even quadruple\nstandard treasure; in these cases, roll for each type of treasure two,\nthree, or four times.</p>\n    <p><i>None</i>: The creature collects no treasure of its own.</p>\n    <p><i>Nonstandard</i>: Some creatures have quirks or habits that\naffect the types of treasure they collect. These creatures use the same</p>\n    <p>treasure tables, but with special adjustments.</p>\n    <p><i>Fractional Coins</i>: Roll on the Coins column in the\nsection corresponding to the creature&rsquo;s Challenge Rating, but\ndivide\nthe result as indicated.</p>\n    <p><i>% Goods or Items</i>: The creature has goods or items only\nsome of the time. Before checking for goods or items, roll d% against\nthe given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll on the\nappropriate Goods or Items column (which may still result in no goods\nor items).</p>\n    <p><i>Double Goods or Items</i>: Roll twice on the appropriate\nGoods or Items column.</p>\n    <p><i>Parenthetical Notes</i>: Some entries for goods or items\ninclude notes that limit the types of treasure a creature collects.</p>\n    <p>When a note includes the word &ldquo;no,&rdquo; it means the\ncreature does\nnot collect or cannot keep that thing. If a random roll generates such\na result, treat the result as &ldquo;none&rdquo; instead. </p>\n    <p>When a note includes the word &ldquo;only,&rdquo; the creature\ngoes out of\nits way to collect treasure of the indicated type.
