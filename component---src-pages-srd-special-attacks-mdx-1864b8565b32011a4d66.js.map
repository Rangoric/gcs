</table>\n    <a id=\"aid-another\"></a><h5>AID ANOTHER</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">In melee combat, you can help a friend attack\nor defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If\nyou&rsquo;re in\nposition to make a melee attack on an opponent that is engaging a\nfriend in melee combat, you can attempt to aid your friend as a\nstandard action. You make an attack roll against AC 10. If you succeed,\nyour friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against\nthat opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent&rsquo;s next\nattack\n(your choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of\nyour next turn. Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and\nsimilar bonuses stack.</p>\n    <p>You can also use this standard action to help a friend in\nother ways, such as when he is affected by a spell, or to assist\nanother character&rsquo;s skill check.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"bull-rush\">BULL RUSH</a></h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">You can make a bull rush as a standard action\n(an attack) or as part of a charge (see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }} href=\"#charge\">Charge</a>,\nbelow). When you make a bull rush, you attempt to push an opponent\nstraight back instead of damaging him. You can only bull rush an\nopponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or\nsmaller.</p>\n    <a id=\"initiating-a-bull-rush\"></a><p><b>Initiating a Bull Rush</b>: First, you move into the\ndefender&rsquo;s space. Doing this provokes an attack of opportunity\nfrom\neach opponent that threatens you, including the defender. (If you have\nthe Improved Bull Rush feat, you don&rsquo;t provoke an attack of\nopportunity\nfrom the defender.) Any attack of opportunity made by anyone other than\nthe defender against you during a bull rush has a 25% chance of\naccidentally targeting the defender instead, and any attack of\nopportunity by anyone other than you against the defender likewise has\na 25% chance of accidentally targeting you. (When someone makes an\nattack of opportunity, make the attack roll and then roll to see\nwhether the attack went astray.) </p>\n    <p>Second, you and the defender make opposed Strength checks. You\neach add a +4 bonus for each size category you are larger than Medium\nor a &ndash;4 penalty for each size category you are smaller than\nMedium. You\nget a +2 bonus if you are charging. The defender gets a +4 bonus if he\nhas more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.</p>\n    <a id=\"bull-rush-results\"></a><p><b>Bull Rush Results</b>: If you beat the defender&rsquo;s\nStrength\ncheck result, you push him back 5 feet. If you wish to move with the\ndefender, you can push him back an additional 5 feet for each 5 points\nby which your check result is greater than the defender&rsquo;s check\nresult.\nYou can&rsquo;t, however, exceed your normal movement limit. (Note: The\ndefender provokes attacks of opportunity if he is moved. So do you, if\nyou move with him. The two of you do not provoke attacks of opportunity\nfrom each other, however.)</p>\n    <p>If you fail to beat the defender&rsquo;s Strength check\nresult, you\nmove 5 feet straight back to where you were before you moved into his\nspace. If that space is occupied, you fall prone in that space.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"charge\">CHARGE</a></h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Charging is a special full-round action that\nallows you to move up to twice your speed and attack during the action.\nHowever, it carries tight restrictions on how you can move.</p>\n    <a id=\"movement-during-a-charge\"></a><p><b>Movement During a Charge</b>: You must move before your\nattack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares) and may\nmove up to double your speed directly toward the designated opponent.\nYou must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder\nyour movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). Here&rsquo;s\nwhat it\nmeans to have a clear path. First, you must move to the closest space\nfrom which you can attack the opponent. (If this space is occupied or\notherwise blocked, you can&rsquo;t charge.) Second, if any line from\nyour\nstarting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks\nmovement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an ally), you\ncan&rsquo;t charge. (Helpless creatures don&rsquo;t stop a charge.)</p>\n    <p>If you don&rsquo;t have line of sight to the opponent at the\nstart\nof your turn, you can&rsquo;t charge that opponent.</p>\n    <p>You can&rsquo;t take a 5-foot step in the same round as a\ncharge.</p>\n    <p>If you are able to take only a standard action or a move\naction on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to\nmove up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed). You\ncan&rsquo;t\nuse this option unless you are restricted to taking only a standard\naction or move action on your turn.</p>\n    <a id=\"attacking-on-a-charge\"></a><p><b>Attacking on a Charge</b>: After moving, you may make a\nsingle melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the attack roll. and take a\n&ndash;2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n    <p>A charging character gets a +2 bonus on the Strength check\nmade to bull rush an opponent (see <a href=\"#bull-rush\">Bull\nRush</a>, above).</p>\n    <p>Even if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high\nenough base attack bonus or from using multiple weapons, you only get\nto make one attack during a charge.</p>\n    <a id=\"lances-and-charge-attacks\"></a><p><b>Lances and Charge Attacks</b>: A lance deals double damage\nif employed by a mounted character in a charge.</p>\n    <p>Weapons Readied against a Charge: Spears, tridents, and\ncertain other piercing weapons deal double damage when readied (set)\nand used against a charging character.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"disarm\">DISARM</a></h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">As a melee attack, you may attempt to disarm\nyour opponent. If you do so with a weapon, you knock the\nopponent&rsquo;s\nweapon out of his hands and to the ground. If you attempt the disarm\nwhile unarmed, you end up with the weapon in your hand.</p>\n    <p>If you&rsquo;re attempting to disarm a melee weapon, follow\nthe\nsteps outlined here. If the item you are attempting to disarm\nisn&rsquo;t a\nmelee weapon the defender may still oppose you with an attack roll, but\ntakes a penalty and can&rsquo;t attempt to disarm you in return if your\nattempt fails.</p>\n    <a id=\"disarm-attack-of-opportunity\"></a><p><b>Step 1: Attack of Opportunity</b>. You provoke an attack of\nopportunity from the target you are trying to disarm. (If you have the\nImproved Disarm feat, you don&rsquo;t incur an attack of opportunity\nfor\nmaking a disarm attempt.) If the defender&rsquo;s attack of opportunity\ndeals\nany damage, your disarm attempt fails.</p>\n    <a id=\"disarm-opposed-rolls\"></a><p><b>Step 2: Opposed Rolls</b>. You and the defender make\nopposed attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a\ntwo-handed weapon on a disarm attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and\nthe wielder of a light weapon takes a &ndash;4 penalty. (An unarmed\nstrike is\nconsidered a light weapon, so you always take a penalty when trying to\ndisarm an opponent by using an unarmed strike.) If the combatants are\nof different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack\nroll of +4 per difference in size category. If the targeted item\nisn&rsquo;t\na melee weapon, the defender takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the roll.</p>\n    <a id=\"disarm-consequences\"></a><p><b>Step Three: Consequences</b>. If you beat the defender, the\ndefender is disarmed. If you attempted the disarm action unarmed, you\nnow have the weapon. If you were armed, the defender&rsquo;s weapon is\non the\nground in the defender&rsquo;s square.</p>\n    <p>If you fail on the disarm attempt, the defender may\nimmediately react and attempt to disarm you with the same sort of\nopposed melee attack roll. His attempt does not provoke an attack of\nopportunity from you. If he fails his disarm attempt, you do not\nsubsequently get a free disarm attempt against him.</p>\n    <p><i>Note</i>: A defender wearing spiked gauntlets can&rsquo;t\nbe\ndisarmed. A defender using a weapon attached to a locked gauntlet gets\na +10 bonus to resist being disarmed.</p>\n    <a id=\"grabbing-items\"></a><h6>Grabbing Items</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">You can use a disarm action to snatch an item\nworn by the target. If you want to have the item in your hand, the\ndisarm must be made as an unarmed attack. If the item is poorly secured\nor otherwise easy to snatch or cut away the attacker gets a +4 bonus.\nUnlike on a normal disarm attempt, failing the attempt doesn&rsquo;t\nallow\nthe defender to attempt to disarm you. This otherwise functions\nidentically to a disarm attempt, as noted above.</p>\n    <p>You can&rsquo;t snatch an item that is well secured unless you\nhave\npinned the wearer (see <a href=\"#grapple\">Grapple</a>). Even then, the\ndefender gains a +4 bonus on his roll to resist the attempt.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"feint\"></a>FEINT</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Feinting is a standard action. To feint, make\na Bluff check opposed by a Sense Motive check by your target. The\ntarget may add his base attack bonus to this Sense Motive check. If\nyour Bluff check result exceeds your target&rsquo;s Sense Motive check\nresult, the next melee attack you make against the target does not\nallow him to use his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must\nbe made on or before your next turn.</p>\n    <p>When feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid you take a\n&ndash;4\npenalty. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2), you take a\n&ndash;8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it&rsquo;s\nimpossible.</p>\n    <p>Feinting in combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n    <a id=\"feinting-as-a-move-action\"></a><p><b>Feinting as a Move Action</b>: With the Improved Feint\nfeat, you can attempt a feint as a move action instead of as a standard\naction.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"grapple\">GRAPPLE</a></h5>\n    <a id=\"grapple-checks\"></a><h6>Grapple Checks</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Repeatedly in a grapple, you need to make\nopposed grapple checks against an opponent. A grapple check is like a\nmelee attack roll. Your attack bonus on a grapple check is:</p>\n    <dl>\n      <dd>\n        <p><b>Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + special size\nmodifier</b></p>\n      </dd>\n    </dl>\n    <a id=\"grapple-special-size-modifier\"></a><p><b>Special Size Modifier</b>: The special size modifier for a\ngrapple check is as follows: Colossal +16, Gargantuan +12, Huge +8,\nLarge +4, Medium +0, Small &ndash;4, Tiny &ndash;8, Diminutive\n&ndash;12, Fine &ndash;16. Use\nthis number in place of the normal size modifier you use when making an\nattack roll.</p>\n    <a id=\"starting-a-grapple\"></a><h6>Starting a Grapple</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">To start a grapple, you need to grab and hold\nyour target. Starting a grapple requires a successful melee attack\nroll. If you get multiple attacks, you can attempt to start a grapple\nmultiple times (at successively lower base attack bonuses).</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-attack-of-opportunity\"></a><p><b>Step 1: Attack of Opportunity</b>. You provoke an attack of\nopportunity from the target you are trying to grapple. If the attack of\nopportunity deals damage, the grapple attempt fails. (Certain monsters\ndo not provoke attacks of opportunity when they attempt to grapple, nor\ndo characters with the Improved Grapple feat.) If the attack of\nopportunity misses or fails to deal damage, proceed to Step 2.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-grab\"></a><p><b>Step 2: Grab</b>. You make a melee touch attack to grab the\ntarget. If you fail to hit the target, the grapple attempt fails. If\nyou succeed, proceed to Step 3.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-hold\"></a><p><b>Step 3: Hold</b>. Make an opposed grapple check as a free\naction. If you succeed, you and your target are now grappling, and you\ndeal damage to the target as if with an unarmed strike.</p>\n    <p>If you lose, you fail to start the grapple. You automatically\nlose an attempt to hold if the target is two or more size categories\nlarger than you are.</p>\n    <p>In case of a tie, the combatant with the higher grapple check\nmodifier wins. If this is a tie, roll again to break the tie.</p>\n    <a id=\"maintain-grapple\"></a><p><b>Step 4: Maintain Grapple</b>. To maintain the grapple for\nlater rounds, you must move into the target&rsquo;s space. (This\nmovement is\nfree and doesn&rsquo;t count as part of your movement in the round.)\nMoving,\nas normal, provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents,\nbut not from your target.</p>\n    <p>If you can&rsquo;t move into your target&rsquo;s space, you\ncan&rsquo;t maintain\nthe grapple and must immediately let go of the target. To grapple\nagain, you must begin at Step 1.</p>\n    <a id=\"grappling-consequences\"></a><h6>Grappling Consequences</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">While you&rsquo;re grappling, your ability to\nattack\nothers and defend yourself is limited.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-no-threatened-squares\"></a><p><b>No Threatened Squares</b>: You don&rsquo;t threaten any\nsquares\nwhile grappling.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-no-dexterity-bonus\"></a><p><b>No Dexterity Bonus</b>: You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC\n(if you have one) against opponents you aren&rsquo;t grappling. (You\ncan\nstill use it against opponents you are grappling.)</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-no-movement\"></a><p><b>No Movement</b>: You can&rsquo;t move normally while\ngrappling.\nYou may, however, make an opposed grapple check (see below) to move\nwhile grappling.</p>\n    <a id=\"if-youre-grappling\"></a><h6>If You&rsquo;re Grappling</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When you are grappling (regardless of who\nstarted the grapple), you can perform any of the following actions.\nSome of these actions take the place of an attack (rather than being a\nstandard action or a move action). If your base attack bonus allows you\nmultiple attacks, you can attempt one of these actions in place of each\nof your attacks, but at successively lower base attack bonuses.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-activate-a-magic-item\"></a><p><b>Activate a Magic Item</b>: You can activate a magic item,\nas long as the item doesn&rsquo;t require a spell completion trigger.\nYou\ndon&rsquo;t need to make a grapple check to activate the item.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-attack-your-opponent\"></a><p><b>Attack Your Opponent</b>: You can make an attack with an\nunarmed strike, natural weapon, or light weapon against another\ncharacter you are grappling. You take a &ndash;4 penalty on such\nattacks. You\ncan&rsquo;t attack with two weapons while grappling, even if both are\nlight\nweapons.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-cast-a-spell\"></a><p><b>Cast a Spell</b>: You can attempt to cast a spell while\ngrappling or even while pinned (see below), provided its casting time\nis no more than 1 standard action, it has no somatic component, and you\nhave in hand any material components or focuses you might need. Any\nspell that requires precise and careful action is impossible to cast\nwhile grappling or being pinned. If the spell is one that you can cast\nwhile grappling, you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell\nlevel) or lose the spell. You don&rsquo;t have to make a successful\ngrapple\ncheck to cast the spell.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-damage-your-opponent\"></a><p><b>Damage Your Opponent</b>: While grappling, you can deal\ndamage to your opponent equivalent to an unarmed strike. Make an\nopposed grapple check in place of an attack. If you win, you deal\nnonlethal damage as normal for your unarmed strike (1d3 points for\nMedium attackers or 1d2 points for Small attackers, plus Strength\nmodifiers). If you want to deal lethal damage, you take a &ndash;4\npenalty on\nyour grapple check.</p>\n    <p><i>Exception</i>: Monks deal more damage on an unarmed strike\nthan other characters, and the damage is lethal. However, they can\nchoose to deal their damage as nonlethal damage when grappling without\ntaking the usual &ndash;4 penalty for changing lethal damage to\nnonlethal\ndamage.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-draw-a-light-weapon\"></a><p><b>Draw a Light Weapon</b>: You can draw a light weapon as a\nmove action with a successful grapple check.</p>\n    <a id=\"escape-from-grapple\"></a><p><b>Escape from Grapple</b>: You can escape a grapple by\nwinning an opposed grapple check in place of making an attack. You can\nmake an Escape Artist check in place of your grapple check if you so\ndesire, but this requires a standard action. If more than one opponent\nis grappling you, your grapple check result has to beat all their\nindividual check results to escape. (Opponents don&rsquo;t have to try\nto\nhold you if they don&rsquo;t want to.) If you escape, you finish the\naction\nby moving into any space adjacent to your opponent(s).</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-move\"></a><p><b>Move</b>: You can move half your speed (bringing all others\nengaged in the grapple with you) by winning an opposed grapple check.\nThis requires a standard action, and you must beat all the other\nindividual check results to move the grapple.</p>\n    <p><i>Note</i>: You get a +4 bonus on your grapple check to move\na pinned opponent, but only if no one else is involved in the grapple.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-retrieve-spell-component\"></a><p><b>Retrieve a Spell Component</b>: You can produce a spell\ncomponent from your pouch while grappling by using a full-round action.\nDoing so does not require a successful grapple check.</p>\n    <a id=\"grapple-pin-your-opponent\"></a><p><b>Pin Your Opponent</b>: You can hold your opponent immobile\nfor 1 round by winning an opposed grapple check (made in place of an\nattack).

Light horses, ponies, and\nheavy horses, however, are frightened by combat. If you don&rsquo;t\ndismount,\nyou must make a DC 20 Ride check each round as a move action to control\nsuch a horse. If you succeed, you can perform a standard action after\nthe move action. If you fail, the move action becomes a full round\naction and you can&rsquo;t do anything else until your next turn.</p>\n    <p>Your mount acts on your initiative count as you direct it. You\nmove at its speed, but the mount uses its action to move.</p>\n    <p>A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a\nspace 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share\nyour mount&rsquo;s space during combat.</p>\n    <a id=\"combat-while-mounted\"></a><p><b>Combat while Mounted</b>: With a DC 5 Ride check, you can\nguide your mount with your knees so as to use both hands to attack or\ndefend yourself. This is a free action.</p>\n    <p>When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on\nfoot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for being on higher ground.\nIf your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee\nattack. Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your\nenemy before attacking, so you can&rsquo;t make a full attack. Even at\nyour\nmount&rsquo;s full speed, you don&rsquo;t take any penalty on melee\nattacks while\nmounted.</p>\n    <p>If your mount charges, you also take the AC penalty associated\nwith a charge.

You can use ranged\nweapons while your mount is running (quadruple speed), at a &ndash;8\npenalty.\nIn either case, you make the attack roll when your mount has completed\nhalf its movement. You can make a full attack with a ranged weapon\nwhile your mount is moving. Likewise, you can take move actions normally</p>\n    <a id=\"casting-spells-while-mounted\"></a><p><b>Casting Spells while Mounted</b>: You can cast a spell\nnormally if your mount moves up to a normal move (its speed) either\nbefore or after you cast. If you have your mount move both before and\nafter you cast a spell, then you&rsquo;re casting the spell while the\nmount\nis moving, and you have to make a Concentration check due to the\nvigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount\nis running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has\nmoved up to twice its speed, but your Concentration check is more\ndifficult due to the violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).</p>\n    <a id=\"if-your-mount-falls-in-battle\"></a><p><b>If Your Mount Falls in Battle</b>: If your mount falls, you\nhave to succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make a soft fall and take no\ndamage.

(In general, you\ncannot take a standard action during a move; this is an exception.)\nWith an overrun, you attempt to plow past or over your opponent (and\nmove through his square) as you move. You can only overrun an opponent\nwho is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.\nYou can make only one overrun attempt per round.</p>\n    <p>If you&rsquo;re attempting to overrun an opponent, follow\nthese\nsteps.</p>\n    <a id=\"overrun-attack-op-opportunity\"></a><p><b>Step 1: Attack of Opportunity</b>.

The defender has the option to\nsimply avoid you. If he avoids you, he doesn&rsquo;t suffer any ill\neffect and you may keep moving (You can always move through a square\noccupied by someone who lets you by.) The overrun attempt doesn&rsquo;t\ncount against your actions this round (except for any movement required\nto enter the opponent&rsquo;s square). If your opponent doesn&rsquo;t\navoid you, move to Step 3.</p>\n    <a id=\"overrun-opponent-blocks\"></a><p><b>Step 3: Opponent Blocks</b>? If your opponent blocks you,\nmake a Strength check opposed by the defender&rsquo;s Dexterity or\nStrength\ncheck (whichever ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant\ngets a +4 bonus on the check for every size category he is larger than\nMedium or a &ndash;4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than\nMedium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check\nif he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal\nhumanoid. If you win, you knock the defender prone. If you lose, the\ndefender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by\nyour Dexterity or Strength check (including the size modifiers noted\nabove, but no other modifiers) to try to knock you prone.</p>\n    <a id=\"overrun-consequences\"></a><p><b>Step 4: Consequences</b>. If you succeed in knocking your\nopponent prone, you can continue your movement as normal. If you fail\nand are knocked prone in turn, you have to move 5 feet back the way you\ncame and fall prone, ending your movement there. If you fail but are\nnot knocked prone, you have to move 5 feet back the way you came,\nending your movement there. If that square is occupied, you fall prone\nin that square.</p>\n    <a id=\"improved-overrun\"></a><p><b>Improved Overrun</b>: If you have the Improved Overrun\nfeat, your target may not choose to avoid you.</p>\n    <a id=\"mounted-overrun-trample\"></a><p><b>Mounted Overrun (Trample)</b>: If you attempt an overrun\nwhile mounted, your mount makes the Strength check to determine the\nsuccess or failure of the overrun attack (and applies its size\nmodifier, rather than yours).

A carried or worn\nobject&rsquo;s\nAC is equal to 10 + its size modifier + the Dexterity modifier of the\ncarrying or wearing character.

To attack with a splash weapon, make a\nranged touch attack against the target. Thrown weapons require no\nweapon proficiency, so you don&rsquo;t take the &ndash;4 nonproficiency\npenalty. A\nhit deals direct hit damage to the target, and splash damage to all\ncreatures within 5 feet of the target.</p>\n    <p>You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat\nthis as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you target a grid\nintersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash\ndamage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. (You\ncan&rsquo;t target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as\na\nLarge or larger creature; in this case, you&rsquo;re aiming at the\ncreature.)</p>\n    <p>If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid\nintersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw,\nwith 1 being straight back at you and 2 through 8 counting clockwise\naround the grid intersection or target creature. Then, count a number\nof squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of\nthe throw.</p>\n    <p>After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash\ndamage to all creatures in adjacent squares.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"trip\"></a>TRIP</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">You can try to trip an opponent as an unarmed\nmelee attack.

A combatant gets a +4 bonus for every size category\nhe is larger than Medium or a &ndash;4 penalty for every size category\nhe is\nsmaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he\nhas more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal\nhumanoid. If you win, you trip the defender.
