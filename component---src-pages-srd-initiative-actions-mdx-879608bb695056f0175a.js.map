When\nyou delay, you voluntarily reduce your own initiative result for the\nrest of the combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up\nlater in the same round, you can act normally. You can specify this new\ninitiative result or just wait until some time later in the round and\nact then, thus fixing your new initiative count at that point.</p>\n    <p>You never get back the time you spend waiting to see what&#8217;s\ngoing to happen. You can&#8217;t, however, interrupt anyone else&#8217;s action (as\nyou can with a readied action).</p>\n    <a id=\"initiative-consequences-of-delaying\"></a><p><b>Initiative Consequences of Delaying</b>: Your initiative\nresult becomes the count on which you took the delayed action. If you\ncome to your next action and have not yet performed an action, you\ndon&#8217;t get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again). If you\ntake a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes\nup, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of\nbattle, and you do not get your regular action that round.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"ready\"></a>READY</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The ready action lets you prepare to take an\naction later, after your turn is over but before your next one has\nbegun. Readying is a standard action. It does not provoke an attack of\nopportunity (though the action that you ready might do so).</p>\n    <a id=\"readying-and-action\"></a><p><b>Readying an Action</b>: You can ready a standard action, a\nmove action, or a free action. To do so, specify the action you will\ntake and the conditions under which you will take it. Then, any time\nbefore your next action, you may take the readied action in response to\nthat condition. The action occurs just before the action that triggers\nit. If the triggered action is part of another character&#8217;s activities,\nyou interrupt the other character. Assuming he is still capable of\ndoing so, he continues his actions once you complete your readied\naction. Your initiative result changes. For the rest of the encounter,\nyour initiative result is the count on which you took the readied\naction, and you act immediately ahead of the character whose action\ntriggered your readied action.</p>\n    <p>You can take a 5-foot step as part of your readied action, but\nonly if you don&#8217;t otherwise move any distance during the round. </p>\n    <a id=\"initiative-consequences-of-readying\"></a><p><b>Initiative Consequences of Readying</b>: Your initiative\nresult becomes the count on which you took the readied action. If you\ncome to your next action and have not yet performed your readied\naction, you don&#8217;t get to take the readied action (though you can ready\nthe same action again). If you take your readied action in the next\nround, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises\nto that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your\nregular action that round.</p>\n    <a id=\"distracting-spellcasters\"></a><p><b>Distracting Spellcasters</b>: You can ready an attack\nagainst a spellcaster with the trigger &#8220;if she starts casting a spell.&#8221;\nIf you damage the spellcaster, she may lose the spell she was trying to\ncast (as determined by her Concentration check result).</p>\n    <a id=\"readying-to-counterspell\"></a><p><b>Readying to Counterspell</b>: You may ready a counterspell\nagainst a spellcaster (often with the trigger &#8220;if she starts casting a\nspell&#8221;). In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a\nchance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If\nyou do, and if you can cast that same spell (are able to cast it and\nhave it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as a\ncounterspell and automatically ruin the other spellcaster&#8217;s spell.\nCounterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.</p>\n    <p>A spellcaster can use dispel magic to counterspell another\nspellcaster, but it doesn&#8217;t always work.</p>\n    <a id=\"readying-a-weapon-against-a-charge\"></a><p><b>Readying a Weapon against a Charge</b>: You can ready\ncertain piercing weapons, setting them to receive charges. A readied\nweapon of this type deals double damage if you score a hit with it\nagainst a charging character.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
