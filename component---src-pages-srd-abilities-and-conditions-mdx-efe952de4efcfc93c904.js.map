If he succeeds, he decides not to go along\nwith that order but remains charmed.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\nA charmed character never obeys a command that is obviously\nsuicidal or grievously harmful to her.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\nIf the charming creature commands his minion to do something\nthat the influenced character would be violently opposed to,\nthe subject may attempt a new saving throw to break free of\nthe influence altogether.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\nA charmed character who is openly attacked by the creature who\ncharmed him or by that creature&rsquo;s apparent allies is\nautomatically freed of the spell or effect.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\nCompulsion is a different matter altogether. A compulsion\noverrides the subject&rsquo;s free will in some way or simply changes\nthe way the subject&rsquo;s mind works.

Usually, a\ncertain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This\ninformation is separated from the damage reduction number by a\nslash. Damage reduction may be overcome by special materials, by\nmagic weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus,\nnot counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain\ntypes of weapons (such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons\nimbued with an alignment. If a dash follows the slash then the\ndamage reduction is effective against any attack that does not\nignore damage reduction.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAmmunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement\nbonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose\nof overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a\nprojectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that\nprojectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already\nhave).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nWhenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an\nattack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the\nattack, such as injury type poison, a monk&rsquo;s stunning, and injury\ntype disease. Damage reduction does not negate touch attacks,\nenergy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor\ndoes it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation,\ningestion, or contact.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAttacks that deal no damage because of the target&rsquo;s damage\nreduction do not disrupt spells.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSpells, spell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical\nfire) ignore damage reduction.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSometimes damage reduction is instant healing. Sometimes damage\nreduction represents the creature&rsquo;s tough hide or body. In either\ncase, characters can see that conventional attacks don&rsquo;t work.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the\ntwo forms of damage reduction do not stack.

A poisoned weapon or object retains\nits venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched\n(unless the poison is wiped off before a target comes in contact\nwith it). Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the\nelements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAlthough supernatural and spell-like poisons are possible,\npoisonous effects are almost always extraordinary.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <p>{`Poisons can be divided into four basic types according to the\nmethod by which their effect is delivered, as follows.`}</p>\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"contact-poison\"></a>\n      <b>Contact</b>: Merely touching this type of poison necessitates a\nsaving throw. It can be actively delivered via a weapon or a touch\nattack. Even if a creature has sufficient damage reduction to\navoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison can still\naffect it. A chest or other object can be smeared with contact\npoison as part of a trap.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"ingested-poison\"></a>\n      <b>Ingested</b>: Ingested poisons are virtually impossible to\nutilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a\npotion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into\ndrinking or eating something poisoned. Assassins and other\ncharacters tend to use ingested poisons outside of combat.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"inhaled-poison\"></a>\n      <b>Inhaled</b>: Inhaled poisons are usually contained in fragile\nvials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged attack with a\nrange increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is\nstruck hard), the container releases its poison. One dose spreads\nto fill the volume of a 10-foot cube. Each creature within the\narea must make a saving throw. (Holding one&rsquo;s breath is\nineffective against inhaled poisons; they affect the nasal\nmembranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"injury-poison\"></a>\n      <b>Injury</b>: This poison must be delivered through a wound. If a\ncreature has sufficient damage reduction to avoid taking any\ndamage from the attack, the poison does not affect it. Traps that\ncause damage from weapons, needles, and the like sometimes contain\ninjury poisons.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThe characteristics of poisons are summarized on Table: Poisons.\nTerms on the table are defined below.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"poison-type\"></a>\n      <i>Type</i>: The poison&rsquo;s method of delivery (contact, ingested,\ninhaled, or via an injury) and the Fortitude save DC to avoid the\npoison&rsquo;s damage.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"poison-initial-damage\"></a>\n      <i>Initial Damage</i>: The damage the character takes immediately\nupon failing his saving throw against this poison. Ability damage\nis temporary unless marked with an asterisk (*), in which case the\nloss is a permanent drain. Paralysis lasts for 2d6 minutes.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"poison-secondary-damage\"></a>\n      <i>Secondary Damage</i>: The amount of damage the character takes\n1 minute after exposure as a result of the poisoning, if he fails\na second saving throw.

In general, whether spell\nresistance applies depends on what the spell does:\n    </p><a id=\"spell-resistance-and-targeted-spells\"></a>\n    <p>\n      <b>Targeted Spells</b>: Spell resistance applies if the spell is\ntargeted at the creature. Some individually targeted spells can be\ndirected at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a\ncreature&rsquo;s spell resistance applies only to the portion of the\nspell actually targeted at that creature. If several different\nresistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its\nspell resistance separately.\n    </p>\n    <p><a id=\"spell-resistance-and-area-spells\"></a>\n      <b>Area Spells</b>: Spell resistance applies if the resistant\ncreature is within the spell&rsquo;s area.

If the creature has\nvoluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to\na spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist that\nspell later, when its spell resistance is up.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nSpell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or\nreleased by the spell actually goes to work on the resistant\ncreature&rsquo;s mind or body.
