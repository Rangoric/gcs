      </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\nBecause magic plays such an important role in the game, the\n    <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"wizard.html\">wizard</a> class offers great opportunities for change when\ndesigning a campaign or a character. The following variants\npresent different versions of the standard specialist\nwizards. Each variant specialist class gives up one of the\nstandard specialists class abilities in exchange for a new\nability unique to the variant specialist. Each specialist\nclass has three variants: one that replaces the specialist's\nsummon familiar ability, one that replaces the specialist's\nbonus feats, and one that replaces the specialist's bonus\nspell per day from the specialty school.\n    <p>\nBecause each variant requires the loss of an existing\nability, you can use more than one of these variants at the\nsame time. By choosing among the variant abilities presented\nfor each specialist, you can easily customize the way that\nmagic works in a campaign, in a geographic region of a\ncampaign, for a school of magic, or even for a single\nspellcaster. Players can easily create unique and interesting\ncharacters using these variants.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nFor example, a campaign might be set up with some or all of\nthe following variants for specialist wizards.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>All abjurers in the campaign have the resistance to\nenergy variant ability because the setting includes a large\nnumber of gates to the elemental planes.\n      </li>\n      <li>Evokers from a specific city all have the overcome\nresistance ability, but they do not gain additional spells as\nspecialist wizards. However, other evokers in the campaign\ngain abilities exactly as standard evokers and consider the\nevokers of that city a disruptive offshoot of the pure study\nof magic.\n      </li>\n      <li>The students and masters at a college of necromancy from\na distant region slowly undergo undead apotheosis instead of\ngaining bonus feats, but most necromancers in the campaign\ngain abilities exactly as standard necromancers. This\ndifference has led some to feel that the foreign necromancers\nhave a more thorough understanding of the powers of death.\nTraditional necromancers have a hard time attracting\nstudents, while the foreigners gain several new apprentices\neach year.\n      </li>\n      <li>One conjurer of particular power in the city cannot\nobtain a familiar and instead casts summoning spells\nexceptionally quickly, as described in the rapid summoning\nvariant ability. He claims he can teach others to wield magic\nas he does, but so far he has gathered few students.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\nIn addition to a description of the variant class's\nabilities, each entry below includes brief suggestions on\nsample campaigns, adventures, or characters that might\nbenefit from the use of the variant specialists. These notes\nare suggestions only, since nearly any campaign can benefit\nfrom adding variety to spells and spellcasters.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAlthough these abilities allow the creation and customization\nof variant classes, a character cannot, for example, take a\nfew levels of conjurer using the rapid summoning variant and\nthen \"multiclass\" into regular conjurer levels. These\nvariants all follow the normal rules for multiclassing by\nspecialist wizards.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"abjurer\"></a>\nABJURER VARIANTS\n    </h5>\nMasters of protective magic, abjurers can fill many roles in\na campaign, from bodyguard to battlemage to adventurer.\nAlthough it lacks offensive options, the school of abjuration\nprovides some of the most effective combat spells in the\ngame. An evoker or transmuter might find it easier to bring\ndown large groups of foes, but an abjurer is far more likely\nto bring herself and her companions through a fight alive.\n    <p>\nIn a campaign with a high degree of intrigue or political\nmachinations, the protective abilities of an abjurer can\nguard against foes both obvious and unexpected, and rival\ngroups of abjurers, all with slightly different powers, might\nvie for prominence among each nation's schemers and\ncourtiers. In combat-heavy campaigns, realms might employ\nabjuration specialists to protect against the battle magic of\ntheir rivals, and in any campaign, adventurers might come to\nrely on the skills of an abjurer to protect against the\ndangers of dungeon and wilderness.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"resistance-to-energy\"></a>\nResistance to Energy (Su)\n    </h6>\nOnce per day, an abjurer using this variant can create a\nmystical shield that grants herself or any one creature that\nshe touches limited protection against a chosen energy type\n(acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The affected\ncreature gains <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy\">resistance</a> equal to 5 plus one-half the\nabjurer's class level against the chosen energy type.\nActivating this ability is a standard action. Once activated,\nthe protection lasts for 1 hour. This protection overlaps\nwith (and does not stack with) the effects of spells such as\n    <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsPtoR.html#resist-energy\">resist energy</a>.\n    <p>\nAn abjurer using this variant permanently gives up the\nability to obtain a familiar.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"aura-of-protection\"></a>\nAura of Protection (Ex)\n    </h6>\nOnce per day, a 5th-level abjurer using this variant can\ngenerate a protective aura that shields against both physical\nand magical attacks. When the abjurer generates this field,\nshe gains a deflection bonus to her Armor Class and a\nresistance bonus on all saving throws equal to her\nIntelligence modifier. This ability requires a standard\naction to activate, and each use protects against only one\nattack or spell. Once activated, the protective aura lasts\nfor 1 minute or until the abjurer is attacked or required to\nmake a saving throw, whichever comes first.\n    <p>\nAn abjurer using this variant can use this ability one\nadditional time per day for every five class levels gained\nabove 5th.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAn abjurer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for\nadvancing as a wizard.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"spontaneous-dispelling\"></a>\nSpontaneous Dispelling (Ex)\n    </h6>\nAt 5th level, an abjurer using this variant gains the ability\nto spontaneously cast the spell <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsDtoE.html#dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a>. This ability is\nsimilar to the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast cure\nspells, with a few exceptions. The abjurer can \"lose\" four or\nmore levels of prepared spells to cast dispel magic. The\nprepared spells can be of any level or combination of levels\nas long as the total spell levels add up to four or more\n(0-level spells don't count). For example, an abjurer using\nthis variant could lose two 2nd-level spells or one 1st-level\nspell and one 3rd-level spell to cast dispel magic.\n    <p>\nAt 11th level, an abjurer can \"lose\" seven or more levels of\nprepared spells to spontaneously cast <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsDtoE.html#greater-dispel-magic\">greater dispel magic</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAn abjurer using this variant can use it in conjunction with\na readied action to use dispel magic or greater dispel magic\nas a counterspell.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAn abjurer using this variant does not gain additional spells\nper day for being a specialist wizard.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"conjurer\"></a>\nCONJURER VARIANTS\n    </h5>\nOne of the most versatile schools of magic, conjuration\noffers its disciples an effective solution to nearly any\ntask: simply summon the appropriate monster and let it solve\nthe problem. In combat, high-level conjurers fight from\nbehind wave after wave of summoned foes, and in most battles\nthey simply direct their summoned allies into the conflict.\nIn addition to these vaunted summoning powers, conjuration\nprovides effective combat spells and access to teleportation\nmagic.\n    <p>\nWhile virtually any campaign can benefit from rival groups of\nconjurers serving diverse agendas, conjurers are particularly\neffective in combat-heavy campaigns. Campaigns that feature a\ngreat deal of long-distance travel or travel between planes\nalso benefit from including diverse groups of conjurers,\nbecause their specialty facilitates travel and encourages a\nthorough understanding of the creatures of the Outer Planes.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"rapid-summoning\"></a>\nRapid Summoning (Ex)\n    </h6>\nAny time a conjurer using this variant casts a <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"spellsS.html#summon-monster-i\">summon monster</a>\nspell, its casting time is 1 standard action rather than 1\nfull round. (Creatures so summoned can only take a standard\naction in the round they are summoned.) Conjurers using this\nvariant gain the normal benefits from enhancing a summon\nmonster spell with the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"featsAll.html#quicken-spell\">Quicken Spell</a> feat.\n    <p>\nA conjurer using this variant permanently gives up the\nability to obtain a familiar.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"enhanced-summoning\"></a>\nEnhanced Summoning (Ex)\n    </h6>\nAt 1st level, a conjurer using this variant gains the\n    <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"featsAll.html#augment-summoning\">Augment Summoning</a> feat for free instead of the <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"featsAll.html#scribe-scroll\">Scribe\nScroll</a> feat.\n    <p>\nAt 5th level, the conjurer's summoned creatures become\nparticularly tough to <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsDtoE.html#dispel-magic\">dispel</a>.

More\nthan any other specialists, diviners excel at gathering\ninformation, and an adventuring party that includes a diviner\nis much more likely to prepare properly for an adventure.\n    <p>\nMany campaigns benefit from featuring more than one type of\ndivination specialist, and diviners can play important parts\nin any game revolving around information gathering. Campaigns\nthat feature mysteries and detective-style adventures, themes\nof prophecy and oracles, or large amounts of social\ninteraction and espionage all make excellent forums for a\ndiviner's powers. In campaigns that feature variant diviners\nwith different class abilities, one simple way to add more\nvariety is to make each distinct group of specialists experts\nin and proponents of a different form of divination. In game\nterms, this divergence is represented by altering the\nmaterial components for some divination spells.

As a practitioner of one of the most subtle\nschools of magic, an enchanter might charm a guard into\nopening a well-defended gate that fifty warriors couldn't\ntake by force. Good-aligned enchanters use their powers to\nseek out truth and encourage others onto the path of good,\nwhile their evil counterparts bend others' minds at their\nwhim and gather personal power as rapidly as possible.\n    <p>\nCampaigns that feature a large amount of social scenarios,\npolitical intrigue, or investigation benefit greatly from the\ninclusion of variant enchanters. These spellcasters, skilled\nin the manipulation of others and capable of concealing their\nown identities, make excellent villains and manipulators, or\neven investigators skilled at using magic to draw the truth\nout of opponents.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nPlayers and game masters alike should also consider the\nramifications that enchantment spells and similar effects\nhave on a game world. Is casting <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsC.html#charm-person\">charm person</a> legal? Is a\ncharacter legally responsible for actions taken while\ncharmed? Do most of the campaign's inhabitants know that\nenchantment effects exist? Are there folk remedies that\nsupposedly provide protection against enchantment effects? Do\nthey actually work? Having ready answers to these and similar\nquestions not only adds consistency to the game, but also\nclarifies and highlights the role of the enchanter.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"cohort\"></a>\nCohort\n    </h6>\nUpon reaching 6th level, an enchanter using this variant\ngains the service of a loyal cohort of the player's choice\n(with the game master's approval).

Their\nprodigious offensive abilities ensure that evokers become the\ncenter of an adventuring group's battle plan.\n    <p>\nCampaigns that include large numbers of wizards aligned to\ndifferent nations are particularly suitable for variant\nevokers, since each nation develops unique cadres of evokers\nto serve in battle. Groups of militant evokers marching in\nunison with more conventional groups can change the tide of\nnearly any battle. In addition, campaigns that include themes\nof primal energy, raw nature, or extreme elemental conditions\ncan all benefit from introducing evokers with variant\nabilities. Evokers in these sorts of campaigns might explore\nthe raw essence of magic, struggling to harness its energies\nin new and unique ways.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"energy-affinity\"></a>\nEnergy Affinity (Ex)\n    </h6>\nEvokers using this variant must choose an energy type (acid,\ncold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This choice is made upon\ncharacter creation and cannot be altered thereafter. Any time\nthe character casts an evocation spell with the chosen energy\ntype, she casts the spell as if her caster level were one\nhigher (affecting range, duration, damage, caster level\nchecks, and any other factor influenced by caster level).\n    <p>\nAn evoker using this variant permanently gives up the ability\nto obtain a familiar.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"energy-substitution\"></a>\nEnergy Substitution (Ex)\n    </h6>\nAn evoker of 5th level or higher using this variant can\nsubstitute energy of one type for another. When casting a\nspell that has an energy descriptor (acid, cold, electricity,\nfire, or sonic), the evoker can change the energy descriptor\nand the spell's effects to energy of a different type.\n    <p>\nUsing this ability is a free action that must be declared\nbefore the spell is cast. The evoker can use this ability\nonce per day for each five class levels he has attained\n(1/day at 5th, 2/day at 10th, and so on).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAn evoker using this variant does not gain bonus feats for\nadvancing as a wizard.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"overcome-resistance\"></a>\nOvercome Resistance (Ex)\n    </h6>\nThe energy spells of an evoker using this variant can ignore\nsome or all of a target's <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579EB6\"\n    }} href=\"monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy\">resistance to energy</a>. Using this\nability is a free action that must be announced before the\nevoker casts the spell to be affected. Every creature\naffected by the spell is treated as if its resistance to the\nspell's energy type was 10 points lower, to a minimum of 0.\n(This lowered resistance applies only to this spell; other\neffects with the same energy descriptor must get through the\ncreature's normal resistance.)\n    <p>\nThe overcome resistance ability does not give the affected\nspell any ability to affect creatures with immunity to the\nspell's energy type, nor does the affected spell have any\nadditional effect on creatures that do not have resistance to\nenergy.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAn evoker may use this ability one time per day, plus one\nadditional time per day for every two class levels attained\nbeyond 1st (2/day at 3rd, 3/day at 5th, and so forth).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nAn evoker using this variant does not gain additional spells\nper day for being a specialist wizard.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"illusionist\"></a>\nILLUSIONIST VARIANTS\n    </h5>\n    <a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/UnA_Gallery/79158.jpg\"><img className=\"art-wide\" src=\"pict.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"pict\" style={{\n        \"border\": \"0px solid\",\n        \"width\": \"73px\",\n        \"height\": \"75px\"\n      }} /></a>\nIllusionists control their surroundings by shaping,\ndistorting, and deceiving the perceptions of others.

Once per day, the\ntransmuter can give up a number of prepared spell levels (up\nto a maximum total equal to half his class level) and prepare\ndifferent spells in their place, as long as the number of\nnewly prepared spell levels is equal to or less than the\nnumber of spell levels given up (0-level spells don't count).\nFor example, a 12th-level transmuter who uses this variant\ncan lose two 1st-level spells and two 2nd-level spells from\nmemory (a total of six spell levels, half the character's\nclass level) and prepare two 3rd-level spells.\n    <p>\nUsing this ability requires a number of minutes of\nconcentration equal to the number of spell levels given up.\nif the transmuter's concentration is broken during this time,\nall spells to be lost are gone and no spells are gained in\ntheir place.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nA transmuter using this variant does not gain additional\nspells per day for being a specialist wizard.\n    </p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
