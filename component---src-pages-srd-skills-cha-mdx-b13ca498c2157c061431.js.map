  <h5>BLUFF (CHA)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: A Bluff check is opposed by the\ntarget&#8217;s <a href=\"skillsAll.html#sense-motive\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Sense Motive</a> check. See the\naccompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the\nmodifier to the target&#8217;s Sense Motive check for each one.</p>\n    <p>Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the\noutcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff\nis hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes\nagainst its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If\nit&#8217;s important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because\nthe target doesn&#8217;t believe it and one that fails because it just asks\ntoo much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on\nits Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and\nthe Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn&#8217;t\nso much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A\ntarget that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.</p>\n    <p>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as\nyou wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or\nbelieves something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not\na suggestion spell. </p>\n    <p>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target.\nCreatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p>\n    <p><i>Feinting in Combat</i>: You can also use Bluff to mislead\nan opponent in melee combat (so that it can&#8217;t dodge your next attack\neffectively). To <a href=\"specialAttacks.html#feint\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>feint</a>, make a Bluff check\nopposed by your target&#8217;s Sense Motive check, but in this case, the\ntarget may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other\napplicable modifiers. If your Bluff check result exceeds this special\nSense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to\nAC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack\nmust be made on or before your next turn.</p>\n    <p>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult\nbecause it&#8217;s harder to read a strange creature&#8217;s body language; you\ntake a &#8211;4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal\nIntelligence (1 or 2) it&#8217;s even harder; you take a &#8211;8 penalty. Against\na nonintelligent creature, it&#8217;s impossible.</p>\n    <p>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n    <p><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use the Bluff\nskill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the\nmomentary diversion you need to attempt a <a href=\"skillsAll.html#hide\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Hide</a> check while people are\naware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n    <p><i>Delivering a Secret Message</i>: You can use Bluff to get a\nmessage across to another character without others understanding it.\nThe DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages,\nespecially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure\nby 4 or less means you can&#8217;t get the message across. Failure by 5 or\nmore means that some false information has been implied or inferred.\nAnyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed\nby the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your\nmessage (see Sense Motive).</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general\ninteraction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round\naction), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A\nBluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a\nstandard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn&#8217;t\ntake an action; it is part of normal communication.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in\nsocial interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again\nin the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks\nmade to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying\nto send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per\nround. Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when\nusing this skill against a favored enemy.</p>\n    <p>The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff\nchecks.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#persuasive\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Persuasive</a> feat, you get a +2\nbonus on Bluff checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get\na +2 bonus on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#diplomacy\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Diplomacy</a>, <a href=\"skillsAll.html#intimidate\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Intimidate</a>,\nand <a href=\"skillsAll.html#sleight-of-hand\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Sleight of Hand</a> checks, as well\nas on <a href=\"skillsAll.html#disguise\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Disguise</a> checks made when you\nknow you&#8217;re being observed and you try to act in character.</p>\n    <p><b>Bluff Examples</b></p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"400px\"\n          }}>Example Circumstances</th>\n          <th>Sense Motive Modifier</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>The target wants to believe you.</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">-5</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>The bluff is believable and doesn&#8217;t affect the target\nmuch.</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">+0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>The bluff is a little hard to believe or puts the\ntarget at some risk.</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">+5</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>The bluff is hard to believe or puts the target at\nsignificant risk.</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">+10</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>The bluff is way out there, almost too incredible to\nconsider.</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">+20</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <h5>DIPLOMACY (CHA)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: You can change the attitudes of\nothers (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see\nthe Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In\nnegotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the\nwinner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when\ntwo advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a\nthird party.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Changing others&#8217; attitudes with Diplomacy\ngenerally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round\nactions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly\nincrease. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action,\nbut you take a &#8211;10 penalty on the check.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Optional, but not recommended because\nretries usually do not work.

If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task\nor trick on its next action.</p>\n    <p><i>&#8220;Push&#8221; an Animal</i>: To push an animal means to get it to\nperform a task or trick that it doesn&#8217;t know but is physically capable\nof performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a\nforced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep\ncycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or\nability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds,\nthe animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>\n    <p><i>Teach an Animal a Trick</i>: You can teach an animal a\nspecific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal\ncheck against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of\n1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an\nIntelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible\ntricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily\nlimited to, the following.</p>\n    <p>Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may\npoint to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and\nit will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids,\nmonstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to\nattack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and\naberrations) counts as two tricks.</p>\n    <p>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally\nwould not do so.</p>\n    <p>Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend\nyou if no threat is present), even without any command being given.\nAlternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other\ncharacter.</p>\n    <p>Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise\nbacks down. An animal that doesn&#8217;t know this trick continues to fight\nuntil it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its\nopponent is defeated.</p>\n    <p>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do\nnot point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.</p>\n    <p>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others\nfrom approaching.</p>\n    <p>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places\nwhere it normally wouldn&#8217;t go.</p>\n    <p>Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple\ntricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</p>\n    <p>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around\nfor anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p>\n    <p>Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to\nreturn. It does not challenge other creatures that come by,</p>\n    <p>though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>\n    <p>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it.\n(This requires the animal to have the scent ability)</p>\n    <p>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy\nload.</p>\n    <p><i>Train an Animal for a Purpose</i>: Rather than teaching an\nanimal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general\npurpose. Essentially, an animal&#8217;s purpose represents a preselected set\nof known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or\nheavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all\ntricks included in the training package. If the package includes more\nthan three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p>\n    <p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though\nif the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and\nbeyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training\nan animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual\ntricks does, but no less time. </p>\n    <p>Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into\ncombat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel.\nTraining an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also\n&#8220;upgrade&#8221; an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding\nby spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal\ncheck. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the\nanimal&#8217;s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and\nriding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they\ndon&#8217;t require any additional training for this purpose.</p>\n    <p>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows\nthe tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting\ntakes three weeks.</p>\n    <p>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks\nattack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes\nfour weeks.</p>\n    <p>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows\nthe tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two\nweeks.</p>\n    <p>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the\ntricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal\nfor hunting takes six weeks.</p>\n    <p>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows\nthe tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for\nperformance takes five weeks.</p>\n    <p>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the\ntricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three\nweeks.</p>\n    <p><i>Rear a Wild Animal</i>: To rear an animal means to raise a\nwild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler\ncan rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. A\nsuccessfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time\nit&#8217;s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Handling an animal is a move action,\nwhile pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can\nhandle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move\naction.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must\nspend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being\nhandled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the\nHandle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear,\nor train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching,\nrearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the\nremainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training.\nIf the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to\ncompletion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal\nautomatically fails.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: You can use this skill on a creature with an\nIntelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any\nsuch check increases by 5.

If you beat your target&#8217;s check result, you may treat the target\nas friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains\nintimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will\nchat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while\nintimidated. See the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#diplomacy\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Diplomacy</a> skill, above, for\nadditional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in\nyour presence, and for 1d6&times;10 minutes afterward. After this time,\nthe target&#8217;s default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if\nnormally unfriendly, to hostile).</p>\n    <p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you\nwith incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your\nefforts.</p>\n    <p><i>Demoralize Opponent</i>: You can also use Intimidate to\nweaken an opponent&#8217;s resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate\ncheck opposed by the target&#8217;s modified level check (see above). If you\nwin, the target becomes <a href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#shaken\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>shaken</a> for 1 round. A shaken\ncharacter takes a &#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and\nsaving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in\nmelee combat and that can see you.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Changing another&#8217;s behavior requires 1\nminute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard\naction.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Optional, but not recommended because\nretries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the\nother character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn&#8217;t\nhelp. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably\nbecome more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is\nfutile.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check\nfor every size category that you are larger than your target.\nConversely, you take a &#8211;4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every\nsize category that you are smaller than your target.</p>\n    <p>A character immune to fear can&#8217;t be intimidated, nor can\nnonintelligent creatures.</p>\n    <p>If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#persuasive\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Persuasive</a> feat, you get a +2\nbonus on Intimidate checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href=\"skillsAll.html#bluff\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Bluff</a>,\nyou get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>\n    <h5>PERFORM (CHA)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform\nis actually a number of separate skills.

The bard&#8217;s special Perform-based abilities are described\nin that class&#8217;s description.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes.

A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to\ninspire competence, 9 ranks to use his suggestion ability, 12 ranks to\ninspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his song of freedom ability, 18\nranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his mass suggestion\nability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.</p>\n    <p>In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain\npeople with sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells\n(especially illusions).</p>\n    <h5>USE MAGIC DEVICE (CHA; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Use this skill to activate magic</p>\n    <p><b>Check</b>: You can use this skill to read a spell or to\nactivate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if\nyou had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you\nwere a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.</p>\n    <p>You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a\ndevice such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an\nalignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make\nthe relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.</p>\n    <p>You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That\nis, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use\nMagic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks\ninvolving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"150px\"\n          }}>Task</th>\n          <th>Use Magic Device DC</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Activate blindly</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">25</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Decipher a written spell</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">25 + spell level</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Use a scroll</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">20 + caster level</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Use a wand</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">20</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Emulate a class feature</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">20</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Emulate an ability score</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">See text</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Emulate a race</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">25</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Emulate an alignment</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\" align=\"center\">30</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p><i>Activate Blindly</i>: Some magic items are activated by\nspecial words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as\nif you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when\nyou&#8217;re not and even if you don&#8217;t know it. You do have to perform some\nequivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must\nspeak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to\nactivate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if\nyou&#8217;ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail\nby 9 or less, you can&#8217;t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more,\nyou suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released\nbut it doesn&#8217;t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are\nthat the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical\nenergy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is\nin addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you\ncast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.</p>\n    <p><i>Decipher a Written Spell</i>: This usage works just like\ndeciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the\nDC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of\nconcentration.</p>\n    <p><i>Emulate an Ability Score</i>: To cast a spell from a\nscroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence\nfor wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer\nor bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class\nyou&#8217;re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is\nyour Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high\nenough score in the appropriate ability, you don&#8217;t need to make this\ncheck.</p>\n    <p><i>Emulate an Alignment</i>: Some magic items have positive or\nnegative effects based on the user&#8217;s alignment. Use Magic Device lets\nyou use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You\ncan emulate only one alignment at a time.</p>\n    <p><i>Emulate a Class Feature</i>: Sometimes you need to use a\nclass feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective\nlevel in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result\nminus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of\nanother class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class\nfeature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment\nrequirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an\nappropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see\nabove).</p>\n    <p><i>Emulate a Race</i>: Some magic items work only for members\nof certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can\nuse such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate\nonly one race at a time.</p>\n    <p><i>Use a Scroll</i>: If you are casting a spell from a scroll,\nyou have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll,\nyou must have the scroll&#8217;s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic\nDevice allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on\nyour class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the\nspell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a\nspell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the\nappropriate ability. If you don&#8217;t have a sufficient score in that\nability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic\nDevice check (see above).</p>\n    <p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion\nmagic items.</p>\n    <p><i>Use a Wand</i>: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the\nwand&#8217;s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you\nto use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell\nlist. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic\nitems, such as staffs.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: None. The Use Magic Device check is made as\npart of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while\nattempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can&#8217;t try to\nactivate that item again for 24 hours.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>\n    <p>You can&#8217;t aid another on Use Magic Device checks.
