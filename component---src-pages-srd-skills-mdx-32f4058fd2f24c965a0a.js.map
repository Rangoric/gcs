The skill modifier incorporates the\ncharacter&#8217;s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that\nskill&#8217;s key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may\napply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher\nthe result, the better.

The\nskill modifier doesn&#8217;t have a skill rank added in because the character\nhas no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the\nmodifier for the skill&#8217;s key ability, are applied to the check.</p>\n    <p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>\n    <a id=\"favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions\"></a><h6>Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Some situations may make a skill easier or\nharder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier\nfor a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.</p>\n    <p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into\naccount exceptional circumstances.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent\nconditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool\nfor the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill\nAttempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.</li>\n      <li>Give the skill user a &#8211;2 circumstance penalty to represent\nconditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use\nimprovised tools or having misleading information.</li>\n      <li>Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the\ntask easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can\nbe subpar.</li>\n      <li>Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make\nthe task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work\nthat must be flawless.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Conditions that affect your character&#8217;s ability to perform the\nskill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the\ncharacter has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to\nthe skill modifier and a reduction in the check&#8217;s DC have the same\nresult: They create a better chance of success. But they represent\ndifferent circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.</p>\n    <a id=\"time-and-skill-checks\"></a><h6>Time and Skill Checks</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Using a skill might take a round, take no\ntime, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are\nstandard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions\ndefine how long activities take to perform within the framework of a\ncombat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to\nthe activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to\nan event, or are included as part of an action. These skill checks are\nnot actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p>\n    <a id=\"checks-without-rolls\"></a><h6>Checks without Rolls</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A skill check represents an attempt to\naccomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or\ndistraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more\nfavorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.</p>\n    <a id=\"taking-10\"></a><p><b>Taking 10</b>: When your character is not being threatened\nor distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for\nthe skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For\nmany routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful.\nDistractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a\ncharacter to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety\nmeasure &#8212;you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but\nfear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the\naverage roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where\na particularly high roll wouldn&#8217;t help.</p>\n    <a id=\"taking-20\"></a><p><b>Taking 20</b>:When you have plenty of time (generally 2\nminutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one\nfull-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no\nthreats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no\npenalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you\nwill get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20\nfor the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a\n20. Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it\nassumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes\ntwenty times as long as making a single check would take. Since taking\n20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding,\nif you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for\nfailure, your character would automatically incur those penalties\nbefore he or she could complete the task. Common &#8220;take 20&#8221; skills\ninclude Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.</p>\n    <a id=\"ability-checks-and-caster-level-checks\"></a><p><b>Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks</b>: The normal take\n10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to\ncaster level checks.</p>\n    <a id=\"combining-skill-attempts\"></a><h5>COMBINING SKILL ATTEMPTS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">When more than one character tries the same\nskill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may\noverlap.</p>\n    <a id=\"individual-events\"></a><h6>Individual Events</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Often, several characters attempt some action\nand each succeeds or fails independently. The result of one character&#8217;s\nClimb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb\ncheck.</p>\n    <a id=\"aid-another\"></a><h6>Aid Another</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">You can help another character achieve success\non his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a\ncooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the\ncharacter you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per\nthe rule for favorable conditions. (You can&#8217;t take 10 on a skill check\nto aid another.) In many cases, a character&#8217;s help won&#8217;t be beneficial,\nor only a limited number of characters can help at once. </p>\n    <p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain\nresults you can&#8217;t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your\ncharacter couldn&#8217;t achieve alone.</p>\n    <a id=\"skill-synergy\"></a><h6>Skill Synergy</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">It&#8217;s possible for a character to have two\nskills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in\none skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of\nits synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some\ncases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in\nquestion, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other\nchecks made by a character, such as those checks required to use\ncertain class features.</p>\n    <a id=\"ability-checks\"></a><h5>ABILITY CHECKS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Sometimes a character tries to do something to\nwhich no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an\nability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate\nability modifier. Essentially, you&#8217;re making an untrained skill check. </p>\n    <p>In some cases, an action is a straight test of one&#8217;s ability\nwith no luck involved. Just as you wouldn&#8217;t make a height check to see\nwho is taller, you don&#8217;t make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</p>\n    <a id=\"skill-descriptions\"></a><h3>SKILL DESCRIPTIONS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">This section describes each skill, including\ncommon uses and typical modifiers.

Exception: <a href=\"skillsAll.html#speak-language\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Speak\nLanguage</a> has &#8220;None&#8221; as its key ability because the use of this\nskill does not require a check.</p>\n    <a id=\"skill-trained-only\"></a><p><b>Trained Only</b>: If this notation is included in the skill\nname line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If it\nis omitted, the skill can be used untrained (with a rank of 0). If any\nspecial notes apply to trained or untrained use, they are covered in\nthe Untrained section (see below).</p>\n    <a id=\"skill-armor-check-penalty\"></a><p><b>Armor Check Penalty</b>: If this notation is included in\nthe skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate)\nto checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check\npenalty does not apply.</p>\n    <p>The skill name line is followed by a general description of\nwhat using the skill represents.

If the skill doesn&#8217;t allow you\nto attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an\ninherent penalty (such as with the <a href=\"skillsAll.html#climb\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Climb</a> skill), you can&#8217;t take 20.\nIf this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried without any\ninherent penalty, other than the additional time required.</p>\n    <a id=\"skill-special\"></a><p><b>Special</b>: Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such\nas special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain\ncharacters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: Some skills grant a bonus to the use of one or\nmore other skills because of a synergistic effect. This entry, when\npresent, indicates what bonuses this skill may grant or receive because\nof such synergies.
