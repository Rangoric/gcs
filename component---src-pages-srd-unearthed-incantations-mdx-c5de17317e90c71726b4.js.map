who are\nnot spellcasters. This variant enables characters who know the correct\nritual gestures and phrases for an incantation to achieve powerful magic\neffects. Incantations don�t use spell slots, you don�t have to prepare\nthem ahead of time, and you can use an incantation an unlimited number of\ntimes per day.\n    <p>\nIncantations have drawbacks: They�re time-consuming to cast, and success\nisn�t assured. They are often expensive, and some require additional\nparticipants to complete the ritual. Some incantations work only under\ncertain specific conditions, such as during a full moon.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nMost important among the drawbacks, an incantation rarely fades away\nquietly if the caster fails to perform the ritual correctly. Instead it\nreverses itself on the caster, explodes with a cascade of magical energy,\nor weakens the barrier between worlds, enabling hostile outsiders to\nemerge onto the Material Plane.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThis variant gives a measure of magical power to nonspellcasters, but the\nincantations themselves are usually too specific in effect to increase a\ncharacter�s power in the general sense. Because many incantations require\nacademic skills such as <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a>, the characters best equipped to cast\nthem are often spellcasters anyway.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIncantations provide a useful way to introduce powerful magical effects in\na lower-level game under controlled conditions. PCs will still use spells\nrather than expensive, risky incantations whenever they can. Incantations\nare also more specific than spells, so the GM can introduce them into the\ngame without worrying that they�ll spread beyond the immediate situation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf you want characters in your low-level game to take a brief sojourn to\nan Outer plane, you can introduce the incantation <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#hrothgars-journey\">Hrothgar�s journey</a>. Because it\nrequires the construction of a thatched hut in the middle of a forest and\nworks only during the winter solstice, you don�t have to worry about the\ncharacters exploring the Outer Planes whenever they get the urge. If you\ngave low-level PCs easy access to the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"spellsPtoR.html#plane-shift\">plane shift</a> spell, on the other\nhand, they could wander the planes until they ran afoul of the first\noutsider more powerful than they are (which is almost any outsider).\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"behind-the-curtain-creating-incantations\"></a>\nBEHIND THE CURTAIN: CREATING INCANTATIONS\n    </h5>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginLeft\": \"40px\"\n    }}>It�s important to realize that this system for creating incantations is\nmeant as a starting point, not the last word. Anytime you apply multiple\nmodifiers to a single DC, the potential for accidental consequences or\nintentional abuse is there.\n      <p>\nTo keep incantations under control in your campaign, avoid creating\nincantations with skill\ncheck DCs lower than 20. Furthermore, you should emphasize how much\nfaster, easier, and safer spells are than incantations. Every incantation\nyou create should have at least one component that�s difficult for the\ncaster to deal with, such as an XP cost, an expensive material component,\nor a significant backlash component. Because incantations don�t require\nspell slots � or even spellcasting ability � you need to make sure that\ncharacters can�t simply cast incantations repeatedly, stopping only to\nsleep.\n      </p>\n      <p>\nIncantations are most effective when they�re specific; they should always\nbe more narrowly focused than spells that accomplish similar tasks. The\n        <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"spellsPtoR.html#planar-binding\">planar binding</a> spell, for example, can trap and compel service from any\nelemental or outsider with 12 HD or less. A comparable incantation,\nXecilgarasp among the bones, would call one specific <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"monstersDtoDe.html#bebilith-demon\">bebilith</a> named\nXecilgarasp for a specific job: guarding a tomb. If ordered to do anything\nelse, Xecilgarasp attacks the caster instead. And if Xecilgarasp ever dies\nwhile guarding a tomb, the incantation is thereafter useless. The\nXecilgarasp among the bones incantation is just as powerful as the planar\nbinding spell in the specific instance it was designed for, but it has\nlimited or no utility beyond that.\n      </p></div>\n    <h5><a id=\"discovering-incantations\"></a>\nDiscovering Incantations\n    </h5>\nObscure tomes and spellbooks filled with mystical ramblings, descriptions\nof magic theory, ordinary arcane spells, and utterly useless or\nincomprehensible magical writing often hide the instructions for\nperforming incantations. In those dusty volumes, diligent readers can find\nincantations with real power � magical recipes that provide step-by-step\ninstructions for achieving a powerful effect.\n    <p>\nIf the characters have access to a well-stocked library of magical\ninformation, finding a set of instructions for a particular incantation\nrequires a successful <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (arcana) check with a DC 10 lower than the\nDC for casting the incantation. Just being aware of the existence of a\nparticular incantation requires a Knowledge (arcana) check with a DC 15\nlower than the incantation�s casting DC.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"casting-an-incantation\"></a>\nCASTING AN INCANTATION\n    </h5>\nAt its simplest, casting an incantation is akin to preparing and cooking\nsomething according to a recipe. You must have the ingredients in hand,\nthen use your skill in cooking to perform each step in order. In game\nterms, this means having the required incantation components, then\nsucceeding on a number of skill checks � often <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a>\n(arcana) checks � during the incantation�s casting time.\n    <p>\nEach incantation description tells how many successful skill checks are required to\ncast the incantation. Unless otherwise specified, the caster makes a skill\ncheck every 10 minutes. If checks involving more than one skill are\nrequired, the checks may be made in any order, as desired by the caster.\nFailing one skill check means that 10 minutes have gone by, and the\nincantation is in danger of failing. If two skill checks in a row are\nfailed, the incantation fails. Each incantation has a consequence\nassociated with failure. Even if the incantation fails, the casting still\nconsumes all the components (including expensive material components and\nexperience points).\n    </p>\n    <p>\nBecause of the unusual outcomes possible on a failure, the GM may choose\nto make these skill\nchecks in secret. Doing this prevents the player of the caster from\nknowing whether an incantation has succeeded or failed. If the consequence\nof failure is immediate and severe (such as death resulting from a failed\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#fires-of-dis\">fires of Dis</a> incantation), the effect is obvious, and concealing it serves\nno purpose.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nMany incantations have a backlash component, which is an ill effect\nsuffered by the caster at the conclusion of the casting or upon failure of\nthe incantation (see <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"#backlash\">Backlash</a>, below).\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"saves-and-spell-resistance\"></a>\nSaves and Spell Resistance\n    </h6>\nIf an incantation allows a save, the formula to calculate the save is\nincluded in the incantation�s description. For checks to overcome spell\nresistance, divide the incantation�s skill check DC by 2 to get\nthe effective caster level for the spell resistance check. For example,\nthe caster of a <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#fires-of-dis\">fires of Dis</a> incantation (DC 23) would add +11 to a d20\nroll when attempting to overcome the spell resistance of the target.\n    <h6><a id=\"interrupting-incantations\"></a>\nInterrupting Incantations\n    </h6>\nIncantations take a long time to cast, but they aren�t as delicate and\nexacting as traditional spells. Casting an incantation does not provoke an\nattack of opportunity, and a caster can even pause the ritual for a short\ntime in order to fight, cast a spell, or take some other action. For each\nround the incantation is interrupted, the DC of all subsequent skill checks to complete the\ncasting increases by 1. Time spent during the interruption of an\nincantation does not count toward the incantation�s casting time.\n    <h6><a id=\"taking-10\"></a>\nTaking 10\n    </h6>\nAs long as the caster of an incantation is not threatened or distracted,\nhe may take 10. Incantations with backlash components or similarly harmful\naspects count as threats that prevent the caster from taking 10. A caster\nmay never take 20 when attempting to complete an incantation.\n    <h5><a id=\"incantation-components\"></a>\nINCANTATION COMPONENTS\n    </h5>\nMost incantations require components not unlike those of spells, including\nverbal, somatic, focus, and material components. In addition, some require\nsecondary casters (abbreviated SC in the Components line of a\ndescription), or cause some sort of backlash (abbreviated B), or cost the\ncaster some amount of experience points (abbreviated XP).\n    <h6><a id=\"secondary-casters\"></a>\nSecondary Casters\n    </h6>\nSome incantations require multiple participants to have any hope of\nsucceeding. These secondary casters are indispensable to the success of\nthe incantation. However, no matter how many people are gathered in the\ndark room, chanting with candles, only one character � most commonly the one\nwith the highest modifier in the relevant skill � is the primary caster who\nmakes the relevant checks. Secondary casters can�t help the primary caster\nsucceed by means of the aid another action, but their presence is required\nfor certain aspects of the ritual nonetheless.\n    <p>\nOften, an incantation is hosted with more than the minimum number of\ncasters. If the primary caster or a secondary caster is killed or\n      <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#disabled\">disabled</a>, one of these bystanders can step into a role.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf an incantation requires a check involving a skill other than <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a>\n(arcana), any secondary caster can make that check if he or she has a\nhigher skill modifier than the primary caster.

They have a backlash component: damage, negative levels, or some\nother effect. The caster experiences the backlash effect regardless of the\nsuccess or failure of the incantation.\n    <h5><a id=\"failed-incantations\"></a>\nFAILED INCANTATIONS\n    </h5>\nWhen two skill\nchecks in a row result in failure (whether or not they�re made by the\nsame character), the incantation as a whole fails. The character who\nfailed the second check experiences the effect indicated in the\nincantation�s description. In general, the consequences of failure can be\ndivided into the following categories. (Many of these effects are not\nmentioned in the sample incantations that follow; they are provided here\nfor use in incantations that could be developed for a campaign.)\n    <p><b><a id=\"attack\"></a>Attack:</b>\nA creature is called from elsewhere to battle the caster (and often any\nbystanders and secondary casters). The incantation�s description tells the\nGM what Challenge Rating the creature should have, how it behaves, and how\nlong it persists.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"augment\"></a>Augment:</b>\nThe incantation was supposed to weaken or destroy its target, but it makes\nthe target more powerful instead. An incantation that deals damage might\nheal its target or cause it to grow in power, for example.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"betrayal\"></a>Betrayal:</b>\nThe incantation seemingly succeeds, but the subject of the incantation\n(or, in rare cases, the caster) undergoes a dramatic alignment change. Over the next 1d6\nminutes, the subject�s alignment becomes the extreme opposite of what it\nwas previously (for instance, lawful good becomes chaotic evil, or chaotic\nneutral becomes lawful neutral; a neutral subject randomly becomes lawful\ngood, lawful evil, chaotic good, or chaotic evil). The subject generally\ntries to keep its new outlook a secret.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"damage\"></a>Damage:</b>\nEither the caster or the target takes damage as the consequence of\nfailure.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"death\"></a>Death:</b>\nSomeone � usually the caster or the target � dies. Some incantations allow a\nsaving throwto avoid this consequence of failure.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"delusion\"></a>Delusion:</b>\nThe caster believes the incantation had the desired effect, but in fact it\nhad no effect or a very different one.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"falsehood\"></a>Falsehood:</b>\nThe incantation (typically a divination) delivers false results to the\ncaster, but the caster believes the results are true.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"hostile-spell\"></a>Hostile Spell:</b>\nThe caster of the incantation is targeted by a harmful spell. The\nincantation description gives the specific spell, save DC, and other\nparticulars.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"mirrorcast\"></a>Mirrorcast:</b>\nThe incantastion has the opposite effect of what was intended.\n    </p>\n    <p><b><a id=\"reversal\"></a>Reversal:</b>\nThe incantation affects the caster rather than the intended target.\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"sample-incantations\"></a>\nSAMPLE INCANTATIONS\n    </h5>\nThe following incantations are among the better-known incantations in\nexistence � which means that no more than a few eldritch scholars know about\nthem. Characters can learn of their existence during the course of an\nadventure by making a <a href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (arcana) check (see <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"#discovering-incantations\">Discovering\nIncantations</a>, above).\n    <h6><a id=\"call-forth-the-dweller\"></a>\nCall Forth the Dweller\n    </h6>\nDivination\n    <b>Effective Level:</b> 6th\n    <b>Skill Check:</b> <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (arcana) DC 20, 6 successes\n    <b>Failure:</b> Falsehood\n    <b>Components:</b> V, S, M, F, XP, B\n    <b>Casting Time:</b> 60 minutes\n    <b>Range:</b> Personal\n    <b>Target:</b> You\n    <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous\n    <b>Saving Throw:</b> None\n    <b>Spell Resistance:</b> No\n    <p>\nThis incantation contacts the enigmatic, extradimensional being known as\nthe Dweller on the Threshold, an entity that imparts knowledge about its\nspecific obsession: doors and other entrances.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTo cast call forth the Dweller, the caster must inscribe forty-two mystic\nsymbols around an open doorway, then begin the chants and supplications\nrequired for the incantation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf the incantation succeeds, an image of the Dweller � an inky mass of\ntentacles and mouths � appears on the other side of the doorway. The Dweller\non the Threshold truthfully answers any questions it is asked about a\nparticular door. For example, the Dweller can provide a magical password\nthat unlocks a door, indicate how to disarm a trap on a door, reveal the\nweaknesses of a door�s guardian, or describe the room that lies beyond the\ndoor. Its answers are clear and fairly specific, if somewhat terse. The\ncaster may well appreciate such concise answers, because one of the\nforty-two symbols inscribed around the doorway during the casting of the\nincantation fades away with each word the Dweller on the Threshold\nspeaks � and when all the symbols are gone, the Dweller disappears.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nIf the caster asks the Dweller on the Threshold a question that doesn�t\ninvolve doors, the Dweller responds with a cutting insult, often about\nsomething the caster thought was secret. Each word of the insult likewise\nmakes a symbol disappear from the perimeter of the doorway.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nThe exact nature of the Dweller on the Threshold is shrouded in mystery.\nSome contend that it is somehow connected to the god of secrets, although\nno one has ever found conclusive evidence that the Dweller on the\nThreshold is evil.\n    </p>\n    <p><b>Option:</b>\nIf the doorway used as the focus is one that the Dweller has been asked\nabout in the past, the caster gains a +4 bonus on the <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (arcana)\nchecks during the incantation. For example, if Boredflak uses call forth\nthe Dweller to learn about the Gateway to Despair, then when he reaches\nthe Gateway, he can use the Gateway as the focus and gain a +4 bonus when\nhe uses the incantation to ask about the Arches of Certain Doom.\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Failure:</i>\nIf the caster fails two consecutive Knowledge (arcana) checks, the Dweller\non the Threshold gleefully lies, employing falsehoods that demonstrate its\ninclination toward mischief and cruelty.\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Material Component:</i>\nForty-two mystic symbols inscribed around the perimeter of the focus\ndoorway (requiring materials costing 500 gp). As described above, these\nsymbols gradually disappear during the time the incantation is in effect.\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Focus:</i>\nAn open doorway large enough to allow a Medium creature to pass through\nit.\n    </p>\n    <p><i>XP Component:</i>\n400 XP.\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Backlash:</i>\nAfter speaking with the Dweller on the Threshold, the caster is <a style={{\n        \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n      }} href=\"abilitiesAndConditions.html#exhausted\">exhausted</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Campaign Use:</i>\nThis incantation is an obvious solution for characters who are \"stuck\"� by\nan especially impenetrable door. The exhaustion backlash makes it less\nlikely they immediately try the door after casting the incantation, and\nthe XP cost ensures that they won�t try to use call forth the Dweller on\nevery door they face. If you introduce this incantation in your game,\nyou�re giving the PCs occasional access to a powerful divination. But\nbecause it�s rather specific, it doesn�t make the characters more\npowerful. Typically, getting through a door lands PCs in trouble more\nquickly than if they were unable to pass the portal.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"fires-of-dis\"></a>\nFires of Dis\n    </h6>\nConjuration (Calling)\n    <b>Effective Level:</b> 6th\n    <b>Skill Check:</b> <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (arcana) DC 23, 6 successes; <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (religion) DC 23, 2 successes; <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (the planes) DC 23, 1 success\n    <b>Failure:</b> Death\n    <b>Components:</b> V, S, M, XP, SC, B\n    <b>Casting Time:</b> 90 minutes\n    <b>Range:</b> Touch\n    <b>Effect:</b> 80-ft.-radius burst centered on caster\n    <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous\n    <b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half (DC 19 + caster's Cha modifier)\n    <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes\n    <p>\nThis incantation, dreamed up by insane cultists, opens a fell rift between\nthe Material Plane and Dis, the fiery second layer of the Nine Hells.

But even a low- to\nmid-level character has a decent chance of making all the skill checks without failing\ntwice in a row, so the incantation could show up in a campaign in a number\nof different circumstances. For instance, the PCs may be tipped off that\nsuicidal cultists are trying to bring the fires of Dis to their city, and\nthey have to disrupt the incantation. The fires of Dis might also have a\nplace in a mystery adventure, where the PCs must discover who stole rare\nalchemical compounds. A routine investigation takes on new urgency when\nthe PCs find out that the missing vials can be the material component for\na fires of Dis incantation.\n    </p>\n    <h6><a id=\"hrothgars-journey\"></a>\nHrothgar�s Journey\n    </h6>\nConjuration (Teleportation)\n    <b>Effective Level:</b> 6th\n    <b>Skill Check:</b> <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (arcana) DC 20, 2 successes; <a style={{\n      \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n    }} href=\"skillsAll.html#perform\">Perform</a> (oratory) DC 20, 4 successes\n    <b>Failure:</b> 5d6 points of fire damage to caster\n    <b>Components:</b> V, S, M, SC, B\n    <b>Casting Time:</b> 60 minutes\n    <b>Range:</b> Touch\n    <b>Target or Targets:</b> Caster plus four to twelve other creatures\n    <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous\n    <b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless) (DC 16 + caster's Cha modifier)\n    <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)\n    <p>\nHrothgar�s journey is an incantation based on the tale of Hrothgar, a\npowerful barbarian hero from ages past. When the poetic epic of Hrothgar\nis recited in the stifling heat of a sweat lodge during the winter\nsolstice, the orator and his listeners receive the same final reward that\nHrothgar did: a one-way trip to a mythic outer plane, where they can\ndrink and make merry with the greatest warriors of myth.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nTo cast the incantation, the caster must construct a small, windowless hut\nin the middle of the forest, then build a bonfire in the hut�s center. At\nleast four and up to twelve others accompany the caster into the hut. Then\nthe flames are lit and the telling of the tale of Hrothgar begins.\n    </p>\n    <p>\nBecause the bonfire is large and the hut is small, the atmosphere inside\nquickly gets stiflingly hot. This is the incantation�s backlash; unlike\nmost backlash components, it affects the incantation�s other targets as\nwell as the caster.

Of all the Outer Planes, this chaotic neutral/chaotic good plane is perhaps the most hospitable to\nPCs and the easiest to work into an ongoing campaign, so the incantation\nmay be a good way to whet the players� appetite for planar travel without\nopening up the entire cosmology. In the hands of NPCs, Hrothgar�s journey\ncan be an escape route for the barbarian raiders the characters have been\nchasing for months. Or a mischievous NPC bard can beckon the PCs into a\nwarm hut on a cold winter�s night, promising them a wondrous reward if\nthey just listen to a tale�\n    </p>\n    <h5><a id=\"crating-new-incantations\"></a>\nCREATING NEW INCANTATIONS\n    </h5>\nMaking unique incantations for your campaign is a tricky balancing act.\nIncantations are intentionally constructed to be much more idiosyncratic\nthan spells are. And because incantations hinge on skill checks, it�s possible\nfor a character to get access to powerful magic before he � or the\ncampaign � is ready for it. The following guidelines will help you balance\nthe benefit of an incantation with its negative aspects, and also\ndetermine how difficult the incantation is to cast.\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        <b><a id=\"determine-school\"></a>Determine School:</b>\nWhen you design an incantation, first decide which school or schools\nthe incantation would fit into if it were a spell. Each school has a\nspecific DC, which serves as the base skill check DC for the\nincantation you�re designing. Consult the descriptions of the <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"magicSchools.html\">schools of\nmagic</a> if you aren�t sure which school an incantation should belong\nto. If you�re designing an incantation that could qualify for more\nthan one school, choose the most important one to provide the base DC.\nOther schools add one-third their DC to the total. For example, the\n        <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"#fires-of-dis\">fires of Dis</a> incantation has conjuration as its most important school\n(because of the <a style={{\n          \"color\": \"#579eb6\"\n        }} href=\"monstersDtoDe.html#pit-fiend-devil\">pit fiend</a> it calls) and evocation as a second school\n(because of the fiery burst it creates). Thus, the fires of Dis\nincantation has a base DC of 41 (30 + 11) for all skill checks made\nduring its casting.\n        <p>\nEach summary below specifies the range, target, duration, and other\naspects of an incantation associated with a particular school.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Abjuration:</i>\nDC 32; Range: Close; Target: One or more creatures, no two of which\ncan be more than 30 ft. apart; Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw: Will\nnegates; Spell Resistance: Yes.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Conjuration:</i>\nDC 30; Range: Close; Target: One creature; Duration: Hours\n(Instantaneous for teleportation subschool); Saving Throw: Will\nnegates (harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless).\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Divination:</i>\nDC 30; Range: Long; Target: Personal; Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw:\nNone; Spell Resistance: No.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Enchantment:</i>\nDC 32; Range: Close; Target: One living creature; Duration: Minutes;\nSaving Throw: Will negates; Spell Resistance: Yes.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Evocation:</i>\nDC 34; Range: Medium; Area: 5-ft.-wide bolt or 20-ft.-radius burst;\nDuration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw:\nReflex half; Spell Resistance: Yes.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Illusion:</i>\nDC 32; Range: Touch; Target: One living creature or 20 cu. ft. of\nmatter; Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw: Will\ndisbelief; Spell Resistance: No.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Necromancy:</i>\nDC 34; Range: Close; Target: One or more creatures or corpses;\nDuration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw:\nNone; Spell Resistance: No.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Transmutation:</i>\nDC 32; Range: Medium; Target: One creature or 20 cu. ft. of matter;\nDuration: Rounds; Saving Throw:\nFortitude half (often harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b><a id=\"modify-dc\"></a>Modify DC:</b>\nNext, determine modifications to the base DC based on the specifics of\nyour ritual; see the table below for a list of general factors and how\nthey change the skill check DC.\nIncreasing the base range of an incantation, for example, is a factor\nthat increases the DC.

Incantations are\nlike 6th- through 9th-level spells, so you can set the effective level\nof the incantation by comparing what the incantation does to what\nspells of that level can accomplish. The effective level determines a\nnumber of aspects of the incantation: how many total successes are\nrequired, the exact save DC of the incantation, and sometimes the\nincantation�s precise range and duration.\n        <p><i>Total Successes:</i>\nEqual to the incantation�s effective level.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Save DC:</i>\n10 + incantation�s effective level + caster�s Cha modifier.\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Duration and Range</i>\nAssume a caster level of twice the incantation�s level, using the same\nformula a spell would.

feet away.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <b><a id=\"table-general-factors-for-incantations\"></a>Table: General Factors for Incantations</b>\n    <table
