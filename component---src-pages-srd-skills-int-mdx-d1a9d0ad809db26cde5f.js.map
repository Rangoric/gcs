</h2>\n    <h5>APPRAISE (INT)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: You can appraise common or\nwell-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you\nestimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual\nvalue.</p>\n    <p>Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check\nagainst DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate\nthe value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item&#8217;s value.</p>\n    <p>A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on\nAppraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed,\nsuch as a gem. A merchant&#8217;s scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on\nAppraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight,\nincluding anything made of precious metals. These bonuses stack.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten\nconsecutive full-round actions).</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: No. You cannot try again on the same object,\nregardless of success.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise\nchecks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are\nfamiliar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of\nstone or metal).</p>\n    <p>The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise\nchecks.</p>\n    <p>A character with the <a href=\"featsAll.html#diligent\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Diligent</a> feat gets a +2 bonus on\nAppraise checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 ranks in any <a href=\"skillsAll.html#craft\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Craft</a>\nskill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made\nwith that Craft skill.</p>\n    <p><b>Untrained</b>: For common items, failure on an untrained\ncheck means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of\n50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).</p>\n    <h5>CRAFT (INT)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft\nis actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft\nskills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.</p>\n    <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something.\nIf nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the\nheading of a Profession skill.</p>\n    <p><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent\nliving, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of\ndedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to\nperform the craft&#8217;s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers,\nand how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants\nearn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>\n    <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow\nyou to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the\ncomplexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and\nthe price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular\nitem. The item&#8217;s finished price also determines the cost of raw\nmaterials.</p>\n    <p>In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the\nresults of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you\nmust make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make\narticles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>\n    <p>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction\nwith the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items\nthat have the strength of steel.</p>\n    <p>When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an\nappropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>\n    <p>All crafts require artisan&#8217;s tools to give the best chance of\nsuccess. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a &#8211;2\ncircumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan&#8217;s tools\nprovide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>\n    <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item,\nfollow these steps.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Find the item&#8217;s price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp\n= 10 sp).</li>\n      <li>Find the DC from the table below.</li>\n      <li>Pay one-third of the item&#8217;s price for the cost of raw\nmaterials.</li>\n      <li>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week&#8217;s\nwork. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If\nthe result &times; the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you\nhave completed the item. (If the result &times; the DC equals double or\ntriple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you&#8217;ve completed\nthe task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the\nDC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result &times; the DC\ndoesn&#8217;t equal the price, then it represents the progress you&#8217;ve made\nthis week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next\nweek. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the\nprice of the item in silver pieces.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this\nweek.</p>\n    <p>If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and\nhave to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>\n    <p><i>Progress by the Day</i>: You can make checks by the day\ninstead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result\n&times; DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.</p>\n    <p><i>Creating Masterwork Items</i>: You can make a masterwork\nitem&#8212;a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on\nits use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being\nmagical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork\ncomponent as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard\nitem. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon\nor 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once\nboth the standard component and the masterwork component are completed,\nthe masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the\nmasterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is\nfor the cost in raw materials.</p>\n    <p><i>Repairing Items</i>: Generally, you can repair an item by\nmaking checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the\nfirst place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item&#8217;s\nprice. </p>\n    <p>When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of\nitem, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are\ntypically as given on the following table.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"410px\"\n          }}>Item</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"110px\"\n          }}>Craft Skill</th>\n          <th>Craft DC</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Acid</td>\n          <td>Alchemy<sup>1</sup></td>\n          <td>15</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Alchemist&#8217;s fire, smokestick, or tindertwig</td>\n          <td>Alchemy<sup>1</sup></td>\n          <td>20</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Antitoxin, sunrod, tanglefoot bag, or thunderstone</td>\n          <td>Alchemy<sup>1</sup></td>\n          <td>25</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Armor or shield</td>\n          <td>Armorsmithing</td>\n          <td>10 + AC bonus</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Longbow or shortbow</td>\n          <td>Bowmaking</td>\n          <td>12</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Composite longbow or composite shortbow</td>\n          <td>Bowmaking</td>\n          <td>15</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Composite longbow or composite shortbow with high\nstrength rating</td>\n          <td>Bowmaking</td>\n          <td>15 + (2 &times; rating)</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Crossbow</td>\n          <td>Weaponsmithing</td>\n          <td>15</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Simple melee or thrown weapon</td>\n          <td>Weaponsmithing</td>\n          <td>12</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Martial melee or thrown weapon</td>\n          <td>Weaponsmithing</td>\n          <td>15</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Exotic melee or thrown weapon</td>\n          <td>Weaponsmithing</td>\n          <td>18</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Mechanical trap</td>\n          <td>Trapmaking</td>\n          <td>Varies<sup>2</sup></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Very simple item (wooden spoon)</td>\n          <td>Varies</td>\n          <td>5</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Typical item (iron pot)</td>\n          <td>Varies</td>\n          <td>10</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>High-quality item (bell)</td>\n          <td>Varies</td>\n          <td>15</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Complex or superior item (lock)</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">Varies</td>\n          <td className=\"last-row\">20</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"3\">1 <i>You must be a spellcaster to craft\nany of these items.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"3\">2 <i>Traps have their own rules for\nconstruction.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Does not apply.

Disabling a simple\ndevice takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or\ncomplex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies.

A magic trap\ngenerally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create\nit.</p>\n    <p>The spells fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and\nteleportation circle also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a\nsuccessful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike stones,\nhowever, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not\nsucceed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>\n    <h6>Other Ways to Beat a Trap</h6>\n    <p className=\"initial\">It&#8217;s possible to ruin many traps without\nmaking a Disable Device check.</p>\n    <p><b>Ranged Attack Traps</b>: Once a trap&#8217;s location is known,\nthe obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism&#8212;assuming the\nmechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it&#8217;s possible to plug up the\nholes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap\nfrom firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through\nthe plugs.</p>\n    <p><b>Melee Attack Traps</b>: These devices can be thwarted by\nsmashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above.\nAlternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might\nbe able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who\nis doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4\ndodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the\nnext minute.</p>\n    <p><b>Pits</b>: Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the\ntrapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a\nmakeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the\nDisable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the\nbottom of a pit by attacking them&#8212;they break just as daggers do.</p>\n    <p><b>Magic Traps</b>: Dispel magic helps here. Someone who\nsucceeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap&#8217;s\ncreator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a\ntargeted dispel magic, not the area version (see the spell description).</p>\n    <h5>FORGERY (INT)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\"><b>Check</b>: Forgery requires writing\nmaterials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or\nsufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you&#8217;re writing, wax\nfor seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which\nthe handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a\ngovernment decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to\nhave seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your\ncheck. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to\ncopy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document\nwritten in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that\nperson&#8217;s handwriting is needed.</p>\n    <p>The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you&#8217;re not sure\nhow good your forgery is. As with <a href=\"skillsAll.html#diguise\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Disguise</a>, you don&#8217;t even need to\nmake a check until someone examines the work. Your Forgery check is\nopposed by the Forgery check of the person who examines the document to\ncheck its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers on his or her\ncheck if any of the conditions on the table below exist.</p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr valign=\"bottom\">\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"300px\"\n          }}>Condition</th>\n          <th>Reader&#8217;s Forgery\nCheck Modifier</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Type of document unknown to reader</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">&#8211;2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Type of document somewhat known to reader</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">+0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Type of document well known to reader</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">+2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Handwriting not known to reader</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">&#8211;2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Handwriting somewhat known to reader</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">+0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Handwriting intimately known to reader</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">+2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Reader only casually reviews the document</td>\n          <td align=\"center\">&#8211;2</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous\nknowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person\nchecking the document can increase that character&#8217;s suspicion (and thus\ncreate favorable circumstances for the checker&#8217;s opposing Forgery\ncheck).</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Forging a very short and simple document takes\nabout 1 minute. A longer or more complex document takes 1d4 minutes per\npage.</p>\n    <p><b>Try Again</b>: Usually, no. A retry is never possible after\na particular reader detects a particular forgery. But the document\ncreated by the forger might still fool someone else. The result of a\nForgery check for a particular document must be used for every instance\nof a different reader examining the document. No reader can attempt to\ndetect a particular forgery more than once; if that one opposed check\ngoes in favor of the forger, then the reader can&#8217;t try using his own\nskill again, even if he&#8217;s suspicious about the document.</p>\n    <p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a href=\"featsAll.html#deceitful\" style={{\n        \"color\": \"rgb(87, 158, 182)\"\n      }}>Deceitful</a>\nfeat, you get a +2 bonus on Forgery checks.</p>\n    <p><b>Restriction</b>: Forgery is language-dependent; thus, to\nforge documents and detect forgeries, you must be able to read and\nwrite the language in question. A barbarian can&#8217;t learn the Forgery\nskill unless he has learned to read and write.</p>\n    <h5>KNOWLEDGE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Like the Craft and Profession skills,\nKnowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge\nrepresents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even\nscientific discipline.</p>\n    <p>Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane\nsymbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</li>\n      <li>Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts,\nbridges, fortifications)</li>\n      <li>Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</li>\n      <li>Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</li>\n      <li>History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of\ncities)</li>\n      <li>Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs,\ntraditions, humanoids)</li>\n      <li>Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants,\nseasons and cycles, weather, vermin)</li>\n      <li>Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees,\nmottoes, personalities)</li>\n      <li>Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic\ntradition, holy symbols, undead)</li>\n      <li>The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral\nPlane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the\nplanes)</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><b>Check</b>: Answering a question within your field of study\nhas a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions),\nor 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>\n    <p>In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and\ntheir special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a\ncheck equals 10 + the monster&#8217;s HD. A successful check allows you to\nremember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5\npoints by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another\npiece of useful information.</p>\n    <p><b>Action</b>: Usually none.
