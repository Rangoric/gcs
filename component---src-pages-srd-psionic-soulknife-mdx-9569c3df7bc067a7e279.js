action, a soulknife can create a semisolid blade composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The blade is identical in all ways (except visually) to a short sword of a size appropriate for its wielder. For instance, a Medium soulknife materializes a Medium mind blade that he can wield as a light weapon, and the blade deals 1d6 points of damage (crit 19-20/x2). Soulknives who are smaller or larger than Medium create mind blades identical to short swords appropriate for their size, with a corresponding change to the blade’s damage. The wielder of a mind blade gains the usual benefits to his attack roll and damage roll from a high Strength bonus. The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A soulknife can use feats such as ",Object(a.b)("a",{href:"featsAll.html#power-attack",style:{color:"rgb(87, 158, 182)"}},"Power Attack")," or ",Object(a.b)("a",{href:"skillsAll.html#combat-expertise",style:{color:"rgb(87, 158, 182)"}},"Combat Expertise")," in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon.
