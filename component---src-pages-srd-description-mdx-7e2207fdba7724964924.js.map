Each alignment\nrepresents a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies,\nso two characters of the same alignment can still be quite different\nfrom each other. In addition, few people are completely consistent.`}</p></p>\n    <h5><a id=\"good-vs-evil\"></a>GOOD VS. EVIL</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Good characters and creatures protect innocent\nlife. Evil characters and creatures debase or destroy innocent life,\nwhether for fun or profit.</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Good&rdquo; implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for\nthe dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal\nsacrifices to help others.</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Evil&rdquo; implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some\nevil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without\nqualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing\nfor sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master. </p>\n    <p>People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have\ncompunctions against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to\nmake sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed\nto others by personal relationships. </p>\n    <p>Being good or evil can be a conscious choice. For most people,\nthough, being good or evil is an attitude that one recognizes but does\nnot choose. Being neutral on the good&ndash;evil axis usually represents a\nlack of commitment one way or the other, but for some it represents a\npositive commitment to a balanced view. While acknowledging that good\nand evil are objective states, not just opinions, these folk maintain\nthat a balance between the two is the proper place for people, or at\nleast for them.</p>\n    <p>Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are\nneutral rather than good or evil. Even deadly vipers and tigers that\neat people are neutral because they lack the capacity for morally right\nor wrong behavior.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"law-vs-chaos\"></a>LAW VS. CHAOS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their\nword, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall\nshort of their duties. Chaotic characters follow their consciences,\nresent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do\nwhat they promise if they feel like it.</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Law&rdquo; implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority,\nand reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include\nclose-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, judgmentalness,\nand a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness\nsay that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can\ndepend on each other and make the right decisions in full confidence\nthat others will act as they should.</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Chaos&rdquo; implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the\ndownside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate\nauthority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote\nchaotic behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows\npeople to express themselves fully and lets society benefit from the\npotential that its individuals have within them.</p>\n    <p>Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a\nnormal respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor\na compulsion to rebel. She is honest but can be tempted into lying or\ndeceiving others.</p>\n    <p>Devotion to law or chaos may be a conscious choice, but more\noften it is a personality trait that is recognized rather than being\nchosen. Neutrality on the lawful&ndash;chaotic axis is usually simply a\nmiddle state, a state of not feeling compelled toward one side or the\nother. Some few such neutrals, however, espouse neutrality as superior\nto law or chaos, regarding each as an extreme with its own blind spots\nand drawbacks.</p>\n    <p>Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are\nneutral. Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited, but they do not\nhave the moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.</p>\n    <h5><a id=\"the-nine-alignments\"></a>THE NINE ALIGNMENTS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Nine distinct alignments define all the\npossible combinations of the lawful&ndash;chaotic axis with the good&ndash;evil\naxis. Each alignment description below depicts a typical character of\nthat alignment. Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that\na given character may act more or less in accord with his or her\nalignment from day to day. Use these descriptions as guidelines, not as\nscripts.</p>\n    <p>The first six alignments, lawful good through chaotic neutral,\nare the standard alignments for player characters. The three evil\nalignments are for monsters and villains.</p>\n    <p><a id=\"lawful-good\"></a><a id=\"crusader\"></a><b>Lawful Good, &ldquo;Crusader&rdquo;</b>: A lawful good character acts\nas a good person is expected or required to act. She combines a\ncommitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly.\nShe tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks\nout against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty\ngo unpunished.</p>\n    <p>Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it\ncombines honor and compassion.</p>\n    <p><a id=\"neutral-good\"></a><a id=\"benefactor\"></a><b>Neutral Good, &ldquo;Benefactor&rdquo;</b>: A neutral good character\ndoes the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping\nothers. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden\nto them.</p>\n    <p>Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means\ndoing what is good without bias for or against order.</p>\n    <p><a id=\"chaotic-good\"></a><a id=\"rebel\"></a><b>Chaotic Good, &ldquo;Rebel&rdquo;</b>: A chaotic good character acts as\nhis conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of\nhim. He makes his own way, but he&rsquo;s kind and benevolent. He believes in\ngoodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He\nhates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do.\nHe follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree\nwith that of society.</p><p>\n      <p>{`Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it\ncombines a good heart with a free spirit.`}</p><p></p>\n      <a id=\"lawful-neutral\"></a><a id=\"judge\"></a><b>Lawful Neutral, &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;</b>: A lawful neutral character\nacts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her. Order and\norganization are paramount to her. She may believe in personal order\nand live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and\nfavor a strong, organized government.</p><p>\n      <p>{`Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it\nmeans you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.`}</p><p></p>\n      <a id=\"true-neutral\"></a><a id=\"undecided\"></a><b>Neutral, &ldquo;Undecided&rdquo;</b>: A neutral character does what\nseems to be a good idea. She doesn&rsquo;t feel strongly one way or the other\nwhen it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral\ncharacters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a\ncommitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better\nthan evil&mdash;after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers\nthan evil ones. Still, she&rsquo;s not personally committed to upholding good\nin any abstract or universal way.</p><p>\n      <p>{`Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves\nphilosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as\nprejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of\nneutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.`}</p><p></p>\n      <p>{`Neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you\nact naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.`}</p><p></p>\n      <a id=\"chaotic-neutral\"></a><a id=\"free-spirit\"></a><b>Chaotic Neutral, &ldquo;Free Spirit&rdquo;</b>: A chaotic neutral\ncharacter follows his whims. He is an individualist first and last. He\nvalues his own liberty but doesn&rsquo;t strive to protect others&rsquo; freedom.\nHe avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A\nchaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations\nas part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be\nmotivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and\na desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic\nneutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally\nrandom. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.</p><p>\n      <p>{`Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it\nrepresents true freedom from both society`}{`’`}{`s restrictions and a\ndo-gooder`}{`’`}{`s zeal.`}</p><p></p>\n      <a id=\"lawful-evil\"></a><a id=\"dominator\"></a><b>Lawful Evil, &ldquo;Dominator&rdquo;</b>: A lawful evil villain\nmethodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of\nconduct without regard for whom it hurts. He cares about tradition,\nloyalty, and order but not about freedom, dignity, or life. He plays by\nthe rules but without mercy or compassion. He is comfortable in a\nhierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He condemns\nothers not according to their actions but according to race, religion,\nhomeland, or social rank. He is loath to break laws or promises. This\nreluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends\non order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds.\nSome lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing\nin cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children\ncome to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these\ncompunctions put them above unprincipled villains.</p><p>\n      <p>{`Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to\nevil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond\nbeing willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in\nspreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as\npart of a duty to an evil deity or master.`}</p><p></p>\n      <p>{`Lawful evil is sometimes called `}{`“`}{`diabolical,`}{`”`}{` because devils\nare the epitome of lawful evil.`}</p><p></p>\n      <p>{`Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it\nrepresents methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.`}</p><p></p>\n      <a id=\"neutral-evil\"></a><a id=\"malefactor\"></a><b>Neutral Evil, &ldquo;Malefactor&rdquo;</b>: A neutral evil villain does\nwhatever she can get away with. She is out for herself, pure and\nsimple. She sheds no tears for those she kills, whether for profit,\nsport, or convenience. She has no love of order and holds no illusion\nthat following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any better or\nmore noble. On the other hand, she doesn&rsquo;t have the restless nature or\nlove of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has.</p><p>\n      <p>{`Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal,\ncommitting evil for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted\nto evil deities or secret societies.`}</p><p></p>\n      <p>{`Neutral evil is the most dangerous alignment because it\nrepresents pure evil without honor and without variation.`}</p><p></p>\n      <a id=\"chaotic-evil\"></a><a id=\"destroyer\"></a><b>Chaotic Evil, &ldquo;Destroyer&rdquo;</b>: A chaotic evil character\ndoes whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to\ndo. He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and\nunpredictable. If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is\nruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and\nchaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any\ngroups he joins or forms are poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil\npeople can be made to work together only by force, and their leader\nlasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate\nhim.</p><p>\n      <p>{`Chaotic evil is sometimes called `}{`“`}{`demonic`}{`”`}{` because demons are\nthe epitome of chaotic evil.`}</p><p></p>\n      <p>{`Chaotic evil is the most dangerous alignment because it\nrepresents the destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the\norder on which beauty and life depend.`}</p></p>\n    <h3><a id=\"vital-statistics\"></a>VITAL STATISTICS</h3>\n    <h5><a id=\"age\"></a>AGE</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">You can choose or randomly generate your\ncharacter&rsquo;s age.
