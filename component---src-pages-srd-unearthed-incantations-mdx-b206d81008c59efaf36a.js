If you�re designing an incantation that could qualify for more than one school, choose the most important one to provide the base DC. Other schools add one-third their DC to the total. For example, the",Object(s.b)("a",{style:{color:"#579eb6"},href:"#fires-of-dis"},"fires of Dis")," incantation has conjuration as its most important school (because of the ",Object(s.b)("a",{style:{color:"#579eb6"},href:"monstersDtoDe.html#pit-fiend-devil"},"pit fiend")," it calls) and evocation as a second school (because of the fiery burst it creates).
