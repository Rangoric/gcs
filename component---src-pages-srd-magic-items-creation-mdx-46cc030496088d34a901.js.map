className=\"subtitle\">Creating Magic Items</span>\n    </h2>\n    <p>To create magic items, spellcasters use special feats. They\ninvest time, money, and their own personal energy (in the form of\nexperience points) in an item&#8217;s creation.</p>\n    <p>Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions.\nThese prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the\ntime, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item&#8217;s\ncreator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is\nallowed).</p>\n    <p>While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note\nthat normally the two primary factors are the caster level of the\ncreator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A\ncreator can create an item at a lower caster level than her own, but\nnever lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell.\nUsing metamagic feats, a caster can place spells in items at a higher\nlevel than normal.</p>\n    <p>Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in\ngp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many items, the market price\nequals the base price.</p>\n    <p>Armor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of\ntheir magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market\nprice. The item cost does not influence the base price (which\ndetermines the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost),\nbut it does increase the final market price.</p>\n    <p>In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly\nmaterial components or with XP components. For these items, the market\nprice equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component\ncosts. Each XP in the component costs adds 5 gp to the market price.\nThe cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost and the base\nXP cost (both determined by the base price) plus the costs for the\ncomponents. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the\ntotal cost of creating the item.</p>\n    <p>The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and\nwell-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing\nspells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day\nper 1,000 gp in the item&#8217;s base price, with a minimum of at least one\nday. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just one\nday to brew.

The easiest way to come up\nwith a price is to match the new item to an item that is already priced\nthat price as a guide. Otherwise, use the guidelines summarized on\nTable: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values.</p>\n    <a id=\"multiple-similar-abilities\"></a><p><b>Multiple Similar Abilities</b>: For items with multiple\nsimilar abilities that don&#8217;t take up space on a character&#8217;s body use\nthe following formula: Calculate the price of the single most costly\nability, then add 75% of the value of the next most costly ability,\nplus one-half the value of any other abilities.</p>\n    <a id=\"multiple-different-abilities\"></a><p><b>Multiple Different Abilities</b>: Abilities such as an\nattack roll bonus or saving throw bonus and a spell-like function are\nnot similar, and their values are simply added together to determine\nthe cost. For items that do take up a space on a character&#8217;s body each\nadditional power not only has no discount but instead has a 50%\nincrease in price.</p>\n    <a id=\"zero-level-spells\"></a><p><b>0-Level Spells</b>: When multiplying spell levels to\ndetermine value, 0- level spells should be treated as 1/2 level.</p>\n    <a id=\"other-considerations\"></a><p><b>Other Considerations</b>: Once you have a final cost\nfigure, reduce that number if either of the following conditions\napplies:</p>\n    <a id=\"item-requires-skill-to-use\"></a><p><i>&#8212;Item Requires Skill to Use</i>: Some items require a\nspecific skill to get them to function. This factor should reduce the\ncost about 10%.</p>\n    <a id=\"item-requires-specific-class-or-alignment-to-use\"></a><p><i>&#8212;Item Requires Specific Class or Alignment to Use</i>: Even\nmore restrictive than requiring a skill, this limitation cuts the cost\nby 30%.</p>\n    <p>Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold\npiece value following the item&#8217;s caster level) are the market value,\nwhich is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item.</p>\n    <p>Since different classes get access to certain spells at\ndifferent levels, the prices for two characters to make the same item\nmight actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the\ncaster of lowest possible level can make it for. Calculate the market\nprice based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes\nthe item.</p>\n    <p>Not all items adhere to these formulas directly. The reasons\nfor this are several. First and foremost, these few formulas aren&#8217;t\nenough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of\na magic item may be modified based on its actual worth. The formulas\nonly provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls assumes that,\nwhenever possible, a wizard or cleric created it. Potions and wands\nfollow the formulas exactly. Staffs follow the formulas closely, and\nother items require at least some judgment calls.</p>\n    <a id=\"masterwork-items\"></a><h5>MASTERWORK ITEMS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Masterwork items are extraordinarily well-made\nitems. They are more expensive, but they benefit the user with improved\nquality. They are not magical in any way. However, only masterwork\nitems may be enhanced to become magic armor and weapons. (Items that\nare not weapons or armor may or may not be masterwork items.)</p>\n    <a id=\"creating-magic-armor\"></a><h5>CREATING MAGIC ARMOR</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">To create magic armor, a character needs a\nheat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. He also needs\na supply of materials, the most obvious being the armor or the pieces\nof the armor to be assembled. Armor to be made into magic armor must be\nmasterwork armor, and the masterwork cost is added to the base price to\ndetermine final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the\nmaterials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic armor&#8212;half\nthe base price of the item.</p>\n    <p>Creating magic armor has a special prerequisite: The creator&#8217;s\ncaster level must be at least three times the enhancement bonus of the\narmor. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability,\nthe higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>\n    <p>Magic armor or a magic shield must have at least a +1\nenhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on Table: Armor\nSpecial Abilities and Table: Shield Special Abilities.</p>\n    <p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the\narmor, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must\nknow the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), must provide any\nmaterial components or focuses the spells require, and must pay any XP\ncosts required for the spells. The act of working on the armor triggers\nthe prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each\nday of the armor&#8217;s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended\nfrom his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>\n    <p>Creating some armor may entail other prerequisites beyond or\nother than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>\n    <p>Crafting magic armor requires one day for each 1,000 gp value\nof the base price.</p>\n    <p><b>Item Creation Feat Required</b>: Craft Magic Arms and Armor.</p>\n    <a id=\"creating-magic-weapons\"></a><h5>CREATING MAGIC WEAPONS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">To create a magic weapon, a character needs a\nheat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. She also\nneeds a supply of materials, the most obvious being the weapon or the\npieces of the weapon to be assembled. Only a masterwork weapon can\nbecome a magic weapon, and the masterwork cost is added to the total\ncost to determine final market value. Additional magic supplies costs\nfor the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic\nweapon&#8212;half the base price given on Table: Weapons, according to the\nweapon&#8217;s total effective bonus.</p>\n    <p>Creating a magic weapon has a special prerequisite: The\ncreator&#8217;s caster level must be at least three times the enhancement\nbonus of the weapon. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a\nspecial ability the higher of the two caster level requirements must be\nmet.</p>\n    <p>A magic weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to\nhave any of the abilities listed on Table: Melee Weapon Special\nAbilities or Table Ranged Weapon Special Abilities.</p>\n    <p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the\nweapon, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must\nknow the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not\nprovide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are\nany XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation\nof the item. The act of working on the weapon triggers the prepared\nspells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the\nweapon&#8217;s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his\ncurrently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>\n    <p>At the time of creation, the creator must decide if the weapon\nglows or not as a side-effect of the magic imbued within it. This\ndecision does not affect the price or the creation time, but once the\nitem is finished, the decision is binding.</p>\n    <p>Creating magic double-headed weapons is treated as creating\ntwo weapons when determining cost, time, XP, and special abilities.</p>\n    <p>Creating some weapons may entail other prerequisites beyond or\nother than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>\n    <p>Crafting a magic weapon requires one day for each 1,000 gp\nvalue of the base price.</p>\n    <p><b>Item Creation Feat Required</b>: Craft Magic Arms and Armor.</p>\n    <a id=\"creating-potions\"></a><h5>CREATING POTIONS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">The creator of a potion needs a level working\nsurface and at least a few containers in which to mix liquids, as well\nas a source of heat to boil the brew. In addition, he needs\ningredients. The costs for materials and ingredients are subsumed in\nthe cost for brewing the potion&#8212;25 gp x the level of the spell x the\nlevel of the caster. All ingredients and materials used to brew a\npotion must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost\nfor brewing each potion. (Economies of scale do not apply.)</p>\n    <p>The imbiber of the potion is both the caster and the target.\nSpells with a range of personal cannot be made into potions.</p>\n    <p>The creator must have prepared the spell to be placed in the\npotion (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and\nmust provide any material component or focus the spell requires.</p>\n    <p>If casting the spell would reduce the caster&#8217;s XP total, he\npays the XP cost upon beginning the brew in addition to the XP cost for\nmaking the potion itself.

The\nact of working on the wand triggers the prepared spell, making it\nunavailable for casting during each day devoted to the wand&#8217;s creation.\n(That is, that spell slot is expended from her currently prepared\nspells, just as if it had been cast.)</p>\n    <p>Crafting a wand requires one day per each 1,000 gp of the base\nprice.</p>\n    <p><b>Item Creation Feat Required</b>: Craft Wand.</p>\n    <a id=\"table-wand-base-price-by-crafters-class\"></a><p><b>WAND BASE PRICES (BY CRAFTER'S CLASS)</b></p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"575px\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Spell Level</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Clr, Drd, Wiz</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Sor</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Brd</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Pal, Rgr*</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>0</td>\n          <td>375 gp</td>\n          <td>375 gp</td>\n          <td>375 gp</td>\n          <td>&#8212;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>1st</td>\n          <td>750 gp</td>\n          <td>750 gp</td>\n          <td>1,500 gp</td>\n          <td>1,500 gp</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>2nd</td>\n          <td>4,500 gp</td>\n          <td>6,000 gp</td>\n          <td>6,000 gp</td>\n          <td>6,000 gp</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>3rd</td>\n          <td>11,250 gp</td>\n          <td>13,500 gp</td>\n          <td>15,750 gp</td>\n          <td>11,250 gp</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>4th</td>\n          <td>21,000 gp</td>\n          <td>24,000 gp</td>\n          <td>30,000 gp</td>\n          <td>21,000 gp</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"5\">* <i>Caster level is half class level.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"5\"><i>Prices assume that the wand was made at\nthe minimum caster level.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <a id=\"table-base-magic-supplies-and-xp-cost-to-craft-a-wand-by-crafters-class\"></a><p><b>BASE MAGIC SUPPLIES AND XP COST TO CRAFT A WAND (BY\nCRAFTER'S CLASS)</b></p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"575px\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Spell Level</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Clr, Drd, Wiz</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Sor</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Brd</th>\n          <th style={{\n            \"width\": \"20%\"\n          }}>Pal, Rgr*</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>0</td>\n          <td>187 gp 5 sp\n+15 XP</td>\n          <td>187 gp 5 sp\n+15 XP</td>\n          <td>187 gp 5 sp\n+15 XP</td>\n          <td>&#8212;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>1st</td>\n          <td>375 gp\n30 XP</td>\n          <td>375 gp\n30 XP</td>\n          <td>750 gp\n+60 XP</td>\n          <td>750 gp\n+60 XP</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>2nd</td>\n          <td>2,250 gp\n180 XP</td>\n          <td>3,000 gp\n+240 XP</td>\n          <td>3,000 gp\n+240 XP</td>\n          <td>3,000 gp\n+240 XP</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>3rd</td>\n          <td>5,625 gp\n+450 XP</td>\n          <td>6,750 gp\n+540 XP</td>\n          <td>7,785 gp\n+630 XP</td>\n          <td>5,625 gp\n+450 XP</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>4th</td>\n          <td>10,500 gp\n+840 XP</td>\n          <td>12,000 gp\n+960 XP</td>\n          <td>15,000 gp\n+1,200 XP</td>\n          <td>10,500 gp\n+840 XP</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"5\">* <i>Caster level is half class level.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan=\"5\"><i>Costs assume that the creator makes the\nwand at the minimum caster level.</i></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <a id=\"creating-wondrous-items\"></a><h5>CREATING WONDROUS ITEMS</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">To create a wondrous item, a character usually\nneeds some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. She also\nneeds a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or\nthe pieces of the item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is\nsubsumed in the cost for creating the item. Wondrous item costs are\ndifficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold\nPiece Values and use the item prices in the item descriptions as a\nguideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.</p>\n    <p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the\nitem, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must\nknow the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not\nprovide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are\nany XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation\nof the item. The act of working on the item triggers the prepared\nspells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the\nitem&#8217;s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his\ncurrently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>\n    <p>Creating some items may entail other prerequisites beyond or\nother than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>\n    <p>Crafting a wondrous item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of\nthe base price.</p>\n    <p><b>Item Creation Feat Required</b>: Craft Wondrous Item.</p>\n    <a id=\"intelligent-item-creation\"></a><h5>INTELLIGENT ITEM CREATION</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">To create an intelligent item, a character\nmust have a caster level of 15th or higher. Time and creation cost are\nbased on the normal item creation rules, with the market price values\non Table: Item Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities treated\nas additions to time, gp cost, and XP cost. The item&#8217;s alignment is the\nsame as its creator&#8217;s. Determine other features randomly, following the\nguidelines in the relevant section.</p>\n    <a id=\"adding-new-abilities\"></a><h5>ADDING NEW ABILITIES</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">A creator can add new magical abilities to a\nmagic item with no restrictions. The cost to do this is the same as if\nthe item was not magical. Thus, a +1 longsword can be made into a +2\nvorpal longsword, with the cost to create it being equal to that of a\n+2 vorpal sword minus the cost of a +1 sword.</p>\n    <p>If the item is one that occupies a specific place on a\ncharacter&#8217;s body the cost of adding any additional ability to that item\nincreases by 50%. For example, if a character adds the power to confer\ninvisibility to her ring of protection +2, the cost of adding this\nability is the same as for creating a ring of invisibility multiplied\nby 1.5.</p>\n    <a id=\"body-slot-affinities\"></a><h5>BODY SLOT AFFINITIES</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Each location on the body, or body slot, has\none or more affinities: a word or phrase that describes the general\nfunction or nature of magic items designed for that body slot. Body\nslot affinities are deliberately broad, abstract categorizations,\nbecause a hard-and-fast rule can&#8217;t cover the great variety among\nwondrous items.</p>\n    <p>You can use the affinities in the list below to guide your\ndecisions on which magic items should be allowed in which body slots.\nAnd when you design your own magic items, the affinities give you some\nguidance for what form a particular item should take.</p>\n    <p>Some body slots have different affinities for different\nspecific items. </p>\n    <a id=\"table-body-slot-affinities\"></a><table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"1\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"575px\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Body Slot</th>\n          <th>Affinity</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Headband, helmet</td>\n          <td>Mental improvement, ranged attacks</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Hat</td>\n          <td>Interaction</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Phylactery</td>\n          <td>Morale, alignment</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Eye lenses, goggles</td>\n          <td>Vision</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Cloak, cape, mantle</td>\n          <td>Transformation, protection</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, scarab</td>\n          <td>Protection, discernment</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Robe</td>\n          <td>Multiple effects</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Shirt</td>\n          <td>Physical improvement</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Vest, vestment</td>\n          <td>Class ability improvement</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Bracers</td>\n          <td>Combat</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Bracelets</td>\n          <td>Allies</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Gloves</td>\n          <td>Quickness</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Gauntlets</td>\n          <td>Destructive power</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Belt</td>\n          <td>Physical improvement</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr className=\"odd-row\">\n          <td>Boots</td>\n          <td>Movement</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>Wondrous items that don&#8217;t match the affinity for a particular\nbody slot should cost 50% more than wondrous items that match the\naffinity.</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","id","style","className","border","cellPadding","cellSpacing","colSpan","valign","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
