sometimes have intelligence of\ntheir own. Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and feel\nthe same way characters do and should be treated as NPCs. Intelligent\nitems have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and\nspecial purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use\nitems or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that\npotions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.)\nIn general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.</p>\n    <p>Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because\nthey have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Treat them as\nconstructs. Intelligent items often have the ability to illuminate\ntheir surroundings at will (as magic weapons do); many cannot see\notherwise.</p>\n    <p>Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their\nown powers without waiting for a command word from their owner.\nIntelligent items act during their owner&#8217;s turn in the initiative order.</p>\n    <a id=\"intelligent-item-alignment\"></a><h5>INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT</h5>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Any item with intelligence has an alignment.\nNote that intelligent weapons already have alignments, either stated or\nby implication. If you&#8217;re generating a random intelligent weapon, that\nweapon&#8217;s alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented special\nabilities it has.</p>\n    <p>Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of\nthe item (except as noted by the asterisks on the table) gains one\nnegative level if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this\nnegative level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long\nas the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including\nrestoration spells). This negative level is cumulative with any other\npenalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders. Items\nwith Ego scores (see below) of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels.\nItems with Ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.</p>\n    <a

A\npurpose of &#8220;defeat/slay arcane spellcasters&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean that the\nsword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it\nmean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard,\nsorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates\narcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local wizard&#8217;s cabal to\nruin, as well as end the rule of a sorceress-queen in a nearby land.\nLikewise, a purpose of &#8220;defend elves&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean that if the wielder\nis an elf, he only wants to help himself. It means that the item wants\nto be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies\nand aiding their leaders. A purpose of &#8220;defeat/slay all&#8221; isn&#8217;t just a\nmatter of self-preservation.

The item is, of course, absolutely true to its\nalignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that\nalignment&#8217;s goals or the item&#8217;s special purpose, personality\nconflict&#8212;item against character&#8212;results. Similarly, any item with an\nEgo score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any\ncharacter, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not\nalways agree with the item.</p>\n    <p>When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a\nWill saving throw (DC = item&#8217;s Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is\ndominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one\nday or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a\nserious threat to either the item or the character, and so on). Should\nan item gain dominance, it resists the character&#8217;s desires and demands\nconcessions such as any of the following.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or\npersonality is distasteful to the item.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>The character divesting herself of all other magic items\nor items of a certain type.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where\nthey go for its own purposes.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to\nthe item.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Magical protections and devices to protect the item from\nmolestation when it is not in use.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>That the character carry the item with her on all\noccasions.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more\nsuitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher\nmeasures, such as the following acts: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>Force its possessor into combat.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Refuse to strike opponents.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Strike at its wielder or her associates.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Cause itself to drop from the character&#8217;s grasp.</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns\nbetween the character&#8217;s and item&#8217;s alignments or when their purposes\nand personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have\na lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain\ndominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better\naccomplish its goals.</p>\n    <p>All magic items with personalities desire to play an important\nrole in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items\nare rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No\nintelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent\nitem is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60\nfeet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract\ntheir host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course,\nalignment might change this sort of behavior. </p>\n    <p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or\nsilenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never\nsuccessfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force\ntheir demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and\ndemands.</p>\n    <a id=\"cursed-items\"></a><h3>CURSED ITEMS</h3>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" style={{\n      \"width\": \"100%\"\n    }}>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p className=\"initial\">Cursed items are magic items with some sort of\npotentially negative impact.

A character&#8217;s ability to gain control of a sphere of\nannihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a\ncontrol check against DC 30 (a move action).

The wielder of the stone can, three times per day,\ncall upon it to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell stone shape,\naffecting 5,000 cubic feet of material.

The bearer of an Orb can dominate dragons of its\nparticular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster), the dragon\nbeing forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (Spell resistance is\nnot useful against this effect.) Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon\nthe wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These\nvalues replace whatever values the character would otherwise have,\nwhether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by\nany means short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character\npossessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon&#8212;but only\nthe breath weapon&#8212;of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb.

If\nwithin 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb&#8217;s variety, the wielder can\ndetermine the exact location and age of the creature.
